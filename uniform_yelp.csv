They are running a 20% off sale on their already very low priced buffet; what they should do is raise prices and improve their food quality and food handling.

Sushi means cooked vinegared rice, but the rice that they use in theirs has no flavor at all and just falls apart as soon as you touch it.  When they bring out a new pan of food they dump the contents of the old tray on top of it so there is no way of telling how old some of the pieces are.",0,0,0

I ordered the ginseng oolong milk tea while my partner ordered the black sugar milk tea with egg pudding. I was a bit disappointed with both our orders. My oolong tea was rich, but that's all I tasted. I have had ginseng tea before, so I expected some aroma or a tiniest bit of ginseng to the drink. Unfortunately, I didn't receive any. One thing I did really appreciate was the fact that they put my sugar on the side. I was able to control how sweet I wanted my tea - as opposed to having sugar overdose. 

My partners black sugar milk tea with pudding was a special on the menu. It was actually very very sweet. But when you have it with the pudding, the sweetness is toned down. It was a little too sweet for me and him, so we decided to mix our drinks in our tea cups. It was an excellent idea, because my tea was not as sweet, so putting them together was the perfect combination. Otherwise, we didn't taste anything special with his drink. 

The one thing I really love about tenren (at least at this location), is the decor. It's very beautiful and gives a twist to the traditional asian decor set in tea shops. I also love how all the hot teas came in tea pots and cup set. They also have a semi-store inside the shop where you can purchase tea leaves, tea sets, and other products. Very cute. As for customer service, they were very prompt to taking our requests. However, I agree with other comments in terms of the cost. It is set pretty high. I would probably return, but not too often.",0,0,0

Stopped in here for a bite to eat while killing time before an appointment. Walked in and was not even acknowledged. We sat ourselves down and it took about 15 to 20 mins before the server came to ask what we would like to drink. There was a table with four guests that walked in way after we did and had their order taken before we did. It took almost another 20 mins to get our order and once it arrived there was a few things wrong. I ordered the sampler platter which came with onion rings, mozzarella sticks, chicken tenders, and potato bites; my father inlaw ordered the 2 egg breakfast plate which came with hash browns and toast. My onion rings were over cooked, the chicken tenders were over cooked to a point and the mozzarella sticks were slightly over cooked as well. I also ordered a Dr Pepper to drink. My father inlaw ordered a peach tea that tasted more like regular tea with a lemon wedge. His hash browns were under cooked but the eggs came out cooked to my specification. They weren't even busy and they had only two server's that were taking orders. Some lady in a pink shirt was probably a manager but not for sure. I will not recommend this restaurant unless you are willing to wait about an hour for your food. Also my father inlaw had to use the restroom before we left and he told me that the stall was smaller then he can get into with his walker. He is handicapped and had a hard time getting in the stall. My complaint isn't merely about the server's is more towards the restaurant it self. We had to come up from Prescott Valley and where we had to be this place was close by. So I hope someone will do something about there speed of service and customer service could use and upgrade. Thanx",0,0,0

On a busy day, the floor employees will stick to you like a tick, especially if you're buying big, in hopes of making commission. On a not so busy day, and say your product is less than $100, you'll be lucky to find help. My Dad was looking to pick-up either of the following - a Roku, a Google Chromecast or an Apple TV. 

Employee 1: Obviously the in-house Apple guy. Did a quick sell for the Apple product (doesn't need much selling, really). Refused to comment about any other product in the store. Moved way too much when he spoke. Nicer than the next employee for sure. 

Employee 2: Pot bellied, lazy guy who was more interested in chewing his gum than helping someone out. Barely answered my Dad's questions, chewed on his gum as his responses to most. Lazily picked up the Roku products and shrugged after reading the details - couldn't really explain how one was different from the other. When we asked about the Google Chromecast, he said ""Best Product!"".. but the product wasn't even in store yet. Way to go, Salesman! 

We left without buying anything. Went to the Best Buy right across the street and found some help with the products. 

Note: My Dad and I are tech savvy and don't bother floor employees with stupid, silly questions about the products. What we were primarily concerned about was hooking up these products with our Projector-Screen theater.",2,0,0

The food is decent and the servers are attentive. I always get the buffalo wings. Not the best I've had, but pretty good as far as a sports bar is concerned.

As regulars during the football season, we typically try to get there early. They won't sit you at the big tables until your whole group is there. This can be frustrating when you're waiting for one person, but you have to be sitting in a corner with a bad view of your game.

When I arrived I noticed that they had a 2for? special so I thought I would give it a try.  The nice girl at one of the counters took my order for a Turkey Panini, and the line moved me along so I ordered a small soup.  The total around $9 for a half sandwich and soup, which is a bit high, though not horrible as long as there is some value.  Unfortunately I ordered for take out so I did not notice until I got back that the nearly $5 half sandwich was pathetic.  The sandwich consisted of  rubbery turnkey, cheese and panini sauce - I thought it would at least have lettuce or something (they never asked if I wanted anything on it).  Really disappointed that they did not even ask if I wanted anything on the sandwich since it would have at least improved the taste.  The turkey was not even as good as the Pepperidge Farms sliced turkey I buy in the store, it seemed to be similar to Subway's turkey.  The cookie was good however, and the soup was OK.  

There are much better places to get a good sandwich for a similar price (Dillys Deli, Jasons, even Wildflower). Needless to say I won't be going back to ""Paradise"".",0,0,0

First, you have to deal with the surly owner-manager.  Certainly not the most friendly person I have ever met, but I am not sure I can completely blame him.  He gets up at like 3am or something, (which  would certainly put me in a bad mood) each morning to come to the law school (another reason) to serve coffee, muffins, and wraps to bratty law students (yet another reason).

The muffins rock, the coffee is Seattle's Best, which is fine by me, although many people complain about this point (see bratty law students comment above).

The problem is when you get to the food.  The space is small and apparently the owner cannot have a grill or similar in this space due to fire codes.  This means that you are mostly left with PB&J or turkey and alfalfa sprout wraps.

The really sad thing is that there is hardly any other decent options in this area, so this place is about as good an option as any.  Blackacre (the name of the lounge area with tables to eat the food, haha) is really crowded come lunch time with aforementioned students.  Best to grab and go at that hour, if you can.",4,0,0

The interior setup is much like a family diner, unlike most BBQ restaurants I have been to. We got to try an array of their popular dishes, notable their ribs and coconut shrimps! I have to admit, I don't remember having ribs so delicious and tender before! The meat simply melted off the bones! My friend and I kept piling our plates with them! The pulled pork sliders and chicken wings were tasty as well, among their other menu items. Honestly, none of the food I tried disappointed me.

If Boneyard Grill opened late, I think it would be a perfect place to go to after some late-night partying. It's also a good family dinner if everyone is craving for some delicious BBQ! If you aren't in the midtown area, they have their original location up in Thornhill.",2,0,0

I totally forgot to take a photo of the food (sorry Robyn) but it looked as good as it tasted.

This super informal restaurant is home to a lovely chilled environment with nice staff and great food. What more could you ask for? Also, it is BYOB with free corkage, so nip next door to Scotmid, grab a cheapy bottle of wine and settle in Tuk Tuk for the evening.

The menu contains a vast array of authentic Indian street food dishes. We order about 8 dishes to share between us, including lamb, veg and chicken, accompanied by a couple of delicious cheese naans and a roti. I can't remember the exact dishes we ordered but everything was so full of flavour and tasty, I would recommend going there and just ordering a variety of dishes that you have no idea what they are.

After we checked in and unpacked, we were jonesin' for some grub and this was the first restaurant we saw in the lobby.

But the location being situated smack dab in the middle of a noisy, heavily trafficked lobby, and the quality of food did little to convince me. 

I had the seared tuna salad. The tuna was absolutely overcooked and the potatoes were very large and seemed shoved into the salad along with the unruly green beans. The glass of Riesling was ok. Granted, the service was adequate and they do make an effort to capture the look of a Parisian cafe (blue painted skies and random Parisian decor) but the hectic atmosphere overshadows all.

In addition to the deposit, you are required to pay three months of rent before signing up (first month and the last two months). When you pay the deposit online, they charge you transaction fees on top. The apartments are old and in crappy shape. Of course, pictures on their site are ridiculously low-quality so the many flaws are concealed. Maintenance requests are responded to, but the repairs are usually half-assed rush jobs that you have to call again to fix. In fact, the very day we moved in, the front door lock was non-functional. You could give the locked door a light push and it would swing open! Many times, they have cut water off without warning in the morning, so if you gotta brush your teeth or take a shower, tough luck. They do warn you in advance that each apartment pays a percentage of the gas bill (based on the number of bedrooms), but you won't know how crazy high it is until you get your bill. The move-out fees are ridiculous, and they will find any reason to withhold your deposit. I sent evidence that a particular modification was there before we moved in, but they ignored it.

After making my decision upon desert she did the only thing she did with any speed throughout the entire night which was rush us out of the table. I assure you her tip reflected her service and even though I live very close to this location, I assure you myself and my family will make the drive to their other Ohio location.

The food is about average and once something runs out from the dim sum carts it takes over 30+ minutes to replenish that food item. This restaurant could definitely use a lot more improvements to service, training, and wait times.",0,1,0

The menu is a bit overwhelming so I will have to go back to try everything else. The mango sushi was amazing as was the beef kabob (can't remember the correct name) but it has a sweet flavor.

The Artisan isn't bad. We went on a First Friday, the night when all the arty nightcrawlers come out.  There was a generous-sized crowd there, making it rather difficult to get a drink. Luckily we knew a cocktail wench that works there and got a comped round (even though she totally burned one of our buddies and totally stole all his shit ... but that's a different review, different day). This was the first time I've ever been and I've heard friends say they've been when they were just about the only party there. 

Valet is a requirement. Unless you want to park in the lot of the adjacent with the ""Will tow at owner's expense"" signs all over the place. 

This place is like Narnia: kind of hard to find. Come from the west side of Sahara and turn right onto Highland. Otherwise, I don't know what to say. 

The decor is pretty garish. They have all of these prints of Da Vinci's, Degas', Renoirs, whatever all done up in these guilded frames. Which isn't a bad thing, if it weren't for the fact that the walls were densly packed with these things. 

They did some innovative things with decor, it wasn't all that bad. 

The DJ was on fire, though. He was the big redeeming point about the place. 

The place isn't suitable for large parties ... as there was like eight of us. 

As shwag as it was, I thought it was odd that they had ESPN on the monitors. 

I will give the Artisan credit for being different from the rest of Vegas. Even though it is kind of the dark side of Roccoco. 

In all fairness I haven't checked out the rest of the hotel, so I couldn't give a thourough review. All we saw was the lounge and the men's bathrooms for a hot minute while we banged in the stalls. jk. It was more like two hot minutes.",1,1,2

I'm not surprised;as  my own experience with the kennel staff has my parents dog & I searching for boarding elsewhere. 
   The hospital staff is incredibly friendly & I can't say enough great things about them. But  the kennel staff is  the complete opposite. First off, when I go into a place of business I expect the staff to be knowledgeable not b*tching about how one of them is a film major and has no interest in the veterinary field or the other girl going on & on about her car\/working on cars,etc... if the staff isn't interested in animals then why do any of them work there?  If this girl is a film major I have to question if she has any training in the vet field at all- probably not. 
   When my parents took their dog in to check the place out in hopes of placing Brady in daycare they asked me to go on a tour with them (since I work in the Vet. field). On Wed's only can you tour the facility at certain hours; red flag #1- if this kennel is up to code & clean you should be able to tour it at any time. #2 the staff had no knowledge what so ever about who flips the bill if there was a dog fight while your pet is in day care. The contract states if your pet is hurt ( at their fault) they pay for it. But when I asked about who pays the expenses if another dog hurts mine they had no answer & no idea that in Summit country you are legally responsible for paying all veterinary expenses if your pet hurts another pet or vs. verse- they didn't  no this!!!! How can you work\/run a kennel & not no the local laws? This is completely irresponsible and concerning on a number of levels. 
  Besides the staff the  tour was equally as disappointing. They had a number of plants directly in the middle of the main section- almost all of them are toxic to dogs!  But mom insisted on trying out day care, Brady stunk so strongly of smoke when we came to pick him up yet it's a ""smoke free"" facility- I think not. Dad noticed a lot of staff members sitting out back smoking directly next to the fenced in area for the dogs to play in. If you do your homework, you'll discover that smoke (both first & second hand) is just as harmful to canines & felines as it is humans & can cause cancer...

If you come to this place on a schedule, you may end up in tears. It's true. But this isn't the kind of place you come to on a schedule; you don't even get cutlery, for god's sake. You eat with your hands, with a shared platter, and a friend you're very comfortable with. And you dig in to the food (when it gets there) and savour every bite of that long-awaited meal. 

I had the meat and vegetarian platter, which I found to be quite good. Especially tasty on my end were the green string beans choice and the tibs. I literally cleaned up. My friend unfortunately did not enjoy his half as much, finding that the meat platter didn't have too many choice cuts. Maybe it's different for just a meat dish. 

The service was not effective nor impressive; the servers seemed tired and maybe sad. But I was nice to them, and the server smiled a little and was kind, despite the glacial pace. Maybe it's part of the communal dining experience (forcing you to talk with your companion for about 2 hours, that is). Or maybe the kitchen is run by a single little old man who makes every dish to order, from scratch. I don't know. But so long as the food is okay and the waitresses are genuine, I can be patient.

Go to any other milk tea\/boba establishment and the drink tastes relatively the same. But tonight my drink tasted nothing like it. Asked the server that this wasn't milk tea and he proceeded to tell me that they changed the powder for the drink. I was disappointed to find out that the regular milk tea could be altered in such a way that the end result doesn't come close to the normal taste of this well known drink. Always enjoyed coming here to satisfy my milk tea craving, but now since their milk tea taste nothing like it, can't help but find another place to go to. I just hope the other Perfect Scoop on Ft.

Will definitely go back, but the service was lacking. The waitress made several mistakes on our order and was not very attentive as we waited 10+ minutes before we ever even greeted. Perhaps this was due to us sitting outside, though we were seated by a hostess... The food comes out as it is finished and there were multiple servers that ultimately helped us out which helped the overall experience.

I stopped in for lunch the other day and sat at the bar.  I found the menu a bit confusing but finally settled on the porkbelly with collard greens.  

It arrived quickly.  The plate was a 5 inch square plate with what was perhaps a 3 oz. piece of porkbelly sitting on top of about a cup of collard greens.  For $12.00.  What was odd, was the porkbelly was sitting in a good half inch of the liquid from the greens, but all I was given was a fork to eat it with and there was also no bread.  Did I mention it was $12.00?  At lunch? I asked for some bread and they brought it out quickly.

The pork belly was pretty good although a bit on the dry side.  The collards were just fine but it's hard to mess up collard greens isn't it?

I asked for the menu again and now I noticed that everything is a la carte, even on the lunch menu.  So I guess I was supposed to order a side of potatoes for an additional six bucks.  

As another Yelper has pointed out, this is after all a restaurant sitting in front of the Walmart so this all seems a bit pretentious.  Look, I don't mind paying for good food in the least but I do object to being presented with a tapas sized portion when I order an entree, particularly when it is involving such low food cost items as pork belly and collard greens.  Seriously, come on guys, what is your food cost on this dish?  I'll guarantee you it's under two bucks.  In my book, that's a rip-off.  

Anyway, I'm not really sure Paradise Valley needs such a precious restaurant but I guess time will tell.   I left hungry and $16.00 poorer.

Finally, I don't get this recent bizarre and unwelcome trend I've observed recently of nice (and expensive) restaurants not serving bread .  What's up with that?  If you're going to serve traditional European\/American food and charge a lot of money, bring some nice artisan bread to the table.",13,2,2

Unfortunately, if you go on their website, you can only purchase a kit with the same flavors, but I think if you call they can personalize it.

The rice side was cold too... in fact the best part of my dinner was the wraps - at least they were warm.

Let's start with what I loved about the place. Cute place, right in the heart of Oakland near the park. The waiter was very friendly and the service was so quick. We were probably in and out within 45 minutes top.

Now here's what I don't like, which really isn't much. The only real complaints I have is around the dish in particular that I got. Eggs benedict is one of my absolute favorite breakfast dishes after huevos rancheros so I will say I am a little bit snobby at times when it comes to my eggs benedict. I think the hollandaise sauce was lacking a little something. I couldn't put my finger on it but it was missing something that would have given it a little more flavor. I also wasn't really pleased with the lack of smoked salmon. I honestly felt like I had maybe 3 bites out of the entire thing that had salmon on it. Which I probably wouldn't have minded if I hadn't ordered the most expensive meal off the menu. Most of the other menu items were around $8-10 I would probably say but mine was $14. At the time I thought that was reasonable given it had salmon on it but after I saw how little salmon was on it I felt that was a little unreasonable. One of the things I loved about the dish was the ketchup and potatoes on the side. It wasn't your average Heinz ketchup, they added something to it that gave it great flavor. Tasted almost like a ketchup my family used to get over in Germany.

There was a long wait and people were packed in everywhere. The location, inside the Imperial Palace, was, well, icky. Even though we had a booth during the meal, I felt like the restaurant was grossly overcrowded, loud, and full of unruly kids. 

I split the Sage Fried Chicken and waffles with my date. I'll admit that neither of us are chicken or waffle fans, but we were really, really hoping to be converted. And that just didn't happen. We got a HUGE plate of food and, between the two of us, did not manage to finish it. The chicken was dry and overseasoned and the waffle was VERY dry and the bacon it contained was overcooked. Time to drench the whole thing in syrup, right? Ehhh. Wrong. The syrup was of pretty poor quality and didn't do much. 

Pluses: the biscuits were amazing and our server was sweet and quick with refills. I won't be back here if I revisit Vegas.",1,1,2

And they agreed to meet my time frame and they did.

They painted both the inside and outside of my house.  And it looks amazing!!  Many of the neighbors have complimented us on how nice the house looks.  These guys may be more than many of the companies out there but are worth it.  I have hired other companies to paint my other houses before and none do a quality job like McMillian.

And just to say, we only came here because it was 3pm and The Local was not open until 5pm.

From the moment we stepped in I could tell the waitress was unhappy with her miserable life, or something. She kept texting on her phone and not paying attention to us even being there... (It was not busy, maybe our table and 3 others) When she FINALLY got up off her butt to come serve us, her arms were crossed in a very closed off and unfriendly manner, as she asked what she could get us. My friend asked for a drink menu in which case the waitress said ""we don't have one"" and looked away from her.. Not even mentioning what she had on tap, what she could get us instead... she just closed off the conversation completely. When we finally ordered, (it was like pulling teeth to get her to tell us what was on tap...) I had the burger which wasn't so terrible.

We did not spend 2hours and 40 minutes by choice, but due to the restaurant's inability to function properly.

I attended the restaurant with 5 other guests and we were seated within 15 minutes which is great for a Saturday evening.  An individual greeted us and stated he will be ""our waiter and bartender"" and took our drink orders.  We later received our drinks, but the individual did not not come back for at least 20 minutes to take our order.  When he took our orders, he did not write anything down.  We jokingly asked ""Are you going to remember all that?"" and he stated he would remember all six orders.  As time went on, no one checked on us for at least 35 minutes and the waiter was never seen again. Eventually, a lady came by and asked ""Is everything going okay?"" I explained to her it was not and we have waited an extremely long time for our food.  The lady expressed her apologies and went to check on our order.  This is when the experience took a complete downfall and one word cannot even describe the experience. Two orders came out which were fine but missing one side.  Another order came out 10 minutes later which was fine.  Another order came out 5 minutes later which was completely the wrong salad.  The salad was replaced and the chicken was cold and the lettuce was not fresh causing the guest to eat it.  I would say thirty minutes went by and two individuals still had not received their meals, which were 2 orders of Cajun Shrimp with sides of collards, rice & beans, mac & cheese.  By this time multiple workers were involved in the situation and could not simply get the last two orders together.  Not only that, but the other guests at the table were done with their meals and two individuals had not received their meals at all.  After a hour (no exaggeration), the two shrimp plates were received.  

The individuals working with the table sent the manager out and I was able to explain the experience.  The manager portrayed to care about the situation and stated it was unacceptable.  Her solution was to provide desserts to the table and to adjust the checks.  I rejected the desserts, but the other guests accepted.  From experience, when a manager states they will adjust a check it means they will reasonably adjust the check for the inconvenience the customer endured, it is their way of showing they are sincerely sorry, and to show the customer it was a mistake and would not happen again. Their solution should leave room for the customer to say ""You know what it is a mistake. I would give them another chance.""  NOPE!  Not this manager. The manager deducted TWO DOLLARS from each check.  This solution was a complete insult and I was highly disappointed in the fact she thought that was reasonable despite her providing desserts. To have waited for two shrimp plates for ONE HOUR, the meal should have been taken off the check.  For a salad to come to the table incorrectly TWICE, the salad should have been removed from the check.  Not only that, I explained to the waiter\/manager the way the check should have been splitted amongst the parties and even that was wrong causing us to be in the restaurant longer.  It was so bad all guests became irritable and were ready to go.  One guests did not even wait on their change to come to the table.

Overall, I would not to return to this restaurant nor recommend it to others.  This restaurant could possibly have the opportunity to tighten its bolts and screws down the road, but I wouldn't give them the time of my day to see if it changes. 

Pros: Out of all the food ordered, the shrimp plates were good, although I would prefer more seasoning in the rice & beans.  I heard one guests say the wings were awesome, as well as the Shrimp & Grits.",0,0,0

I'm pretty disappointed with the latte I had. They were out of anything smaller than a 16oz cup to put it in, so it ended up being mostly soy foam. It also took a very long time to prepare for such a well (too many?) staffed bar.

We had an early brunch reservation so we were the first ones seated for the day, but later in the day reservations would likely be helpful since the place started to fill pretty quickly closer to noon. 

Food - Definite winners are their homemade jams and donuts. Their spinach omelet was impossibly light, fluffy, and surprisingly filling. The eggs benedict were great as well - crispy bacon, sautéed spinach, and hollandaise sauce. My one negative remark would be one of my eggs was beyond poached so it wasn't as runny as its twin.

I arrived about an hour early so I could have time for a full tour to get acquainted with the spa area.  The tour lasted about 45 seconds even after I informed the attendant I had never been there before.  If I hadn't done research before hand by looking the place up online I wouldn't have found out about the pool, bistro, or fitness center.  That's pretty disappointing after having just had to pay a pretty high price up front for a facial with 20% gratuity (not an option, they automatically add this and have you pay up front).  Regardless, I was fine figuring everything out by myself.  

I enjoyed the steam room before heading up to the relaxation room before the facial.  The room looked awesome, tons of lounge chairs, a fireplace, water, & snacks.  However, there was no spa feel at all thanks to over a dozen people in the area talking in loud normal voices.  They probably need to dim the lights, raise the music level, and put up some signs.  There was literally no relaxing here.  

The actual facial was very nice.  Good quality with someone who knew what they were doing.  It was good both quality wise and for relaxing.  

I enjoyed the pool, steam room, and shower before leaving.  No steam shower though which would have been a nice touch.  

In the parking lot as I was leaving a man was yelling at his wife and it kept getting louder until he started physically beating her.  I ran back into the spa to alert the staff.

The restaurant is beautiful, but only from certain tables....other tables look directly into the casino.  Before dining, I didn't think that was a big deal...but there is something about paying $60 for a steak and looking up and seeing not beautiful interiors, but rather the annoying progressive-slot lights, and the silly music that goes along with those slots.  Often, people dine at nice restaurants to get away from that, and at Switch there is no escape. 

The menu changes...so if you went to encorelasvegas.com and looked up the menu and fell in love with some items, don't plan on actually being able to order the items.  Even if you ask nicely.  I REALLY wanted to try the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese, and the waiter said no.  Even though it had been on the websites menu.  

The service at Switch, at least our service, was really poor.  The most the waiter said to us was, ""You ready to order?""  No mention of specials, recommendations, etc.

Finally, after a really bad first impression, we left the restaurant and walked about 20 feet to Botero in The Encore.  It was one of the best dining experiences ever!

You'll see an awesome gothic neon sign in the Palm Casino's Eatery, aka food court, that reads Chronic Tacos. There's a chipotlesque assembly line that offers tacos, burritos, and burrito bowls.  I tried the al pastor burrito ($7) with Spanish rice, black beans, cilantro, cheese, pico de gallo, salsa verde.  Sadly, I forgot to ask for sour cream. 

The al pastor roasting spike was nowhere in sight, and the spiced pork came from a collecting bin. The pork had little depth of flavor, but the bits of pineapple added bursts of sweet brightness. The rest of the burrito was pretty decent and filling. 

The cashier lady told me they didn't do water cups, and told me to go to Earl of Sandwich next door. But my friend got a water cup from Chronic Taco... hmmmmm.

The kitchen was fabulously stocked and we were able to get groceries near by to avoid paying the extreme-o restaurant prices. 
The bathroom was huge and they provide Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries which were much nicer than the usual no-name treats. 
We were asked if we wanted a flat screen tv in our room or a jacuzzi tub and while we chose the flat screen, our bedroom still had a giant tub in it. The bed was very comfortable and while I found it a little short for me, it might have been for the 18 pillows at the head of the bed.

As for the distance away from the strip, it took us approx 45 minutes to walk to the centre (ie Wild Bill's). They're doing construction across the street and so while the area might not be the prettiest, it's a short walk to get to the excitement. There are also multiple bus stops available right outside of the hotel where you can go down the strip or go get groceries. I would suggest buying your bus pass through one of the machines at the Slots A Fun stop, as a 3 day pass will cost much less than what you would pay daily. There's also the monorail train across the street at the Sahara.

However, my recent experience was not so great. We reserved a spot at the tapanyaki table on a Friday evening and the restaurant was clearly low in staff. It took 40 minutes for our beverages to arrive and another 20 for the appetizers. When our chef finally arrived, he did not allow photos or videos to be taken!!! Our table was extremely disappointed and he explained to us he likes his privacy. He was rushing everything and served the stir fry vegetables close towards raw. Imagine a plate full of raw onions!

Secondly, every single person is not going to leave you a cash tip when some are paying together, and some are paying with cards. Common Sense. Lastly, the restaurant actually kept one of our party member's change, which was over $5. They didn't want to demand it as they are non-confrontational.

I told her I didn't care, I was fine with my car that i just wanted something with good gas mileage. When I questioned the charges on the bottom of the contract, she said that those were for ""incidentals"" and that it would go down to my reservation rate when I returned the car.  She ASSURED me that there was no additional charge, clicked through all the boxes and had me sign.  The screen I signed on was so small, scratched and damaged, I couldn't have read the info if I wanted to.  When the final charge hit my account and I called customer service, they said I should have declined the charge.  I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GETTING CHARGED!!

UPDATE:  I was contacted by corporate customer service representative James who corrected the situation completely and assured me that they would be looking into what happened and provide training or guidance or take whatever action would be needed to prevent this from happening in the future.

There was a distinctly off-putting urinal smell hanging in the air, and despite the restaurant being nearly empty, it took nearly 30 minutes for us to even get our entree orders placed. Once we did, the food came out relatively quickly, and the salads and main courses were all delicious. However, dessert was a completely different story.

My wife and I used to frequent this spot when it was Jimmy O'Neill's, just for a slice of their awesome beet cake and maybe a glass of wine. Imagine our surprise and delight when ""Famous Beet Cake"" appeared on Joey's menu. So we ordered a slice, and convinced my wife's parents to do the same. Even though the description left us a little dubious, we were just hoping that somehow some way, Joey's made a deal with Jimmy to bring back the recipe we so missed...

Big Mistake. Not only did it take nearly 20 minutes to prepare, what came from the kitchen bore no resemblance to the beet cake of yore in either taste or presentation. It was sickly sweet, with a vague plastic aftertaste. Instead of a rich chocolate interior, we were given a light-brownish mass with no distinct flavor profile other than sugar. Gone was the delicious chocolate ganache and homemade whipped cream -- in their stead, some hershey's syrup drizzled on top and a scoop of nondescript vanilla ice cream on the side. It was so awful, no one at the table wanted to finish it.

Unfortunately, I hadn't had much luck so far at Pleasure Bar (okay food), or D'Amico's (awful food). I've had more consistent, tasty Italian at the Olive Garden, which is sad. So I decided to give Alexander's Italian Bistro a try.

We stopped in tonight, a Saturday evening. The place was pretty much full and we didn't have a reservation, but we got seated after just a few minutes. The tables are packed pretty tight and you can see the servers dancing around each other precariously. The decor is charming without being all tacky like other local Italian places...I love the beautiful backlit stained glass panels that open the space up. There is a nice little bar area in the front with a smaller bar food menu and a couple nice TVs...we'll have to check that out soon.

Mr. got the Eggplant Alexander, I got the Mafalda Alexander. The eggplant was nice and crispy, not mushy inside like eggplant parmesan can often turn out. It was very rich and definitely two meals worth of food. My pasta was excellent. The noodles were flavorful on their own, and cooked freshly and perfectly. I like the mafalda noodles, which aren't too commonly used in most Italian places. The sauce, a mixture of marinara and alfredo, was tasty and not overpowering. The spicy Italian sausage was soooo good...just the right amount of spicy, tender and flavorful. They give a pretty large basket of bread that is moist, fresh, and flaky.

We got the tiramisu for dessert, which was pretty good. It's hard to find real tiramisu anyways so I give them credit for having it. The ladyfingers were a little bit tough to cut with a spoon but they were good, and the cream was very good, not too sweet. A nice finish to the meal.

Only downsides...no soup or salad included with the dish, those are extra. Our server was nice enough but kinda disappeared when we were finished with our food...we waited around a good 15 minutes for her to come back and wrap Mr.'s leftovers and ask if we wanted dessert, then another 10 minutes after finishing dessert for her to come back with the check. This is one of my top pet peeves.

Alexander himself (I'm pretty sure anyway...) stopped by the table at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, which is always a nice touch in my book. Everyone working there seemed like they must be family, but not the type of family who dread working for the family business, which is nice.

I had the pork butt arepa with cheese, chicken empanadas and fried plantains and passion fruit juice. This came to approximately $15. Not bad for the meal.

I didn't expect the arepa to be so heavy. Imagine an English-muffin like sandwich stuffed to the brim with your meat of choice and cheese. The bread is made of corn flour.  It wasn't bad, but adding their homemade sauces gives it full flavor. The empanada dough was thicker than I'd like but the meat again had a lot of flavor. The plantains were simple. Fried bananas. But it's blandness helped cut the richness of the arepa and empanada.

BIG MISTAKE!!! From the moment I entered, I did not like what I saw. The place was very hot and uncomfortable. There were alot of people eating inside but it was awful noisy (kids running around and parents not caring) I did not know if I was to just sit myself down or wait for assistance...so I picked a table towards the rear of the place and sat down. All the tables looked dirty with grease and finger prints on them. The waitress brought us our menus and then didn't return for about 15 minutes. When she returned, she asked what we wanted. Since the menu had pictures and then you have to hunt for the prices...we were taking a bit to order. The waitress asked if we wanted to take more time to decide (3 TIMES!!!) like she was in a big hurry! We each (3 of us) asked for two pupusas each (mixed) and when the waitress asked for what we wanted to drink, one of us ordered an horchata. The waitress said ""it's Salvadorean style, are you sure you want it?""instead of telling us how or what it's made with...so we ordered it. Being Latinos, we thought it would be close to anything you would get from a Mexican restaurant...WRONG!!! It tasted very bad! So, 20 minutes later, we got our pupusas which were soaked in grease. I cut one open only to expose a thin layer of beans n cheese with not much else. So basically, it's a thin layer of beans and cheese painted in between two corn tortillas!! or so it seemed. We doused them with hot sauce\/salsa (to give them SOME taste) and finished our food. We never saw the waitress come around again so we didn't know if we had to go to the counter to get our check or if it would be brought to us. I went to use the men's restroom to wash up and was bombarded with filth the moment I entered...trash and urine on the floor..grafitti on the walls, light\/fan fixtures and even the trash can..YUCK!!! I felt dirtier coming out than when I entered!! So we paid our bill and left...QUICKLY!!!

I had the beef brisket sandwich and the fries (triple fried).  The brisket sandwich is really tasty and the fries are definitely worth it.  The owner is really nice to talk to.

Without her testimony of the Jidori lunch special, i wouldn't have gave this place a second thought.  Before that I tried the skewers thing once, but my conscious became really uncomfortable after i was like 10-20sticks deep.  It was just a bit too much.

Now that I know about Torikatsu Lunch Special (before 3pm) I feel like i'm getting more than a bargain at $9.50. Comes with two healthy serving of Deep Fried Chicken Cutlet.  The batter they used is amazing and nicely coarse as stated before. 
Also included in that lunch special are Shredded Cabbage w\/ a refreshing Sweet Vinaigrette Soy Dressing, a scoop of Creamy Potato Salad, bowl of fresh Rice, and alas a bowl of Tonjiru.

Tonjiru is a Pork and Vegetable Miso Soup. This particular one contains mushroom, carrots, sliced pork belly, green onions, gobo roots, and nagaimo (yam\/potato).  It's an earthy broth and simply hearty.  After a meal like that it's comforting knowing that i can surrender into this bowl of hope and figure out what the hell am I supposed to do with my life.

*tip* Prior to your meal they drop off a bowl of Sesame Seeds for you to grind before adding to your Tonkatsu sauce to go along with your Chicken Katsu.  
Before you start muddling take out half of it or more. You don't need all that sesame and it's easier to focus on grinding at small base of the bowl than trying to handle all of it at the same time.  You'll progress much more quickly to get that consistency rather spending your time chasing it all.

If you're not into Kushi-Age or any thing deep fried, they offer wide variety of Japanese Tapas, salad, rice dishes, and noodle soup bowls.  Small plates such as sashimi, egg omelet, and Prime Short Ribs Steak.

Maybe not the best ikazaya in town, but they're holding their own just fine. 3.75\/5

For appetizers, we ordered the cheese curds, pretzel, and lamb meatballs. The cheese curds were amazing, basically just fried cheese with marinara sauce. The pretzel was also good - a little burnt in places but nothing too aggravating. It came with nacho cheese and mustard. Our server had the chef chop it up into bite size so we could share easily. Very thoughtful. 

For my lunch entree, I ordered the Dijon chicken. It came with two asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes with sausage chopped up in it. for about $10, i would order this over and over again.

Parking:  Is insane. Get here early! I made my friend get to the race almost two hours early, so we could get a good spot! However, there were others hanging out\/warming up and someone lead a yoga sequence.  

Cost: A bit high. The shirt is a zip-up jacket.   I'm a Lulu and Athleta girl through and through, so the low quality and lack of breathable material of the jacket was rather disappointing. So, I felt the cost of the race was due to this jacket.   That said, it's always a conversation starter. 

Race course:  This was in Scottsdale and was fairly OK - mostly city streets.  Some of the streets were a bit uneven. I noted there was a lot of traffic seemingly waiting for us to pass by?   There were clearly marked mileage signs. I completed the 15K race.   I was able to get into a preferred corral so started in a bit earlier than the entire group of runners.  

Aid stations: There were quite a few port-a-potties along the route at the aid stations. The aid stations provided these snacks: 1) strawberry marshmallows, 2) chocolate pieces, 3) M&Ms, and 4) chocolate marshmallows.  All a bit too sweet for me.  Aid stations also had Gatorade and water.   

Volunteers:  So many!  

Gear check: Easy! 

Snack at the end:  Everyone sees the photo of the huge chocolate mugs.  Ask if the chocolate is lactose-free.  I don't know if it is, but I certainly fell ill about 20-30 minutes post consuming the hot chocolate (I know, I know - it is my fault!)  It was rather delicious going down though!

Now... the place is called Barcelona. Barcelona is a city in Spain. THe closest thing to a Spanish dish on the menu us Paella, otherwise it's a steakhouse menu with a few obligatory pasta dishes. Totally uninspired.

I ordered the ribeye, medium rare. It came out medium, and the glaze and whatever else they put on it were awful, save the two onion rings. I doubt this was USDA prime beef. It just wasn't that good, and the room was so dark that it was hard to see what I was eating. The shoestring fries side were a pleasant surprise - a giant mound of crispy potato. 

My date had some kind of pasta with shrimp dish. The shrimp were overdone, the pasta was, ok. Denny's pasta is OK, too, and let's face it, so is Chef Boyardee... So don't read too much into the complement. 

Barcelona. Spain. The place doesn't look that Spanish on the inside. There is a giant mural on the ceiling, dim lights, it reminds me more of Las Vegas cheese than Spain. 

While you dine, there are two Scottsdouche (or is it Douchedale?) types crooning back and forth to each other on stage. Is this where failed American Idol contestants try to relive their moment of glory? I don't know. They made a reappearance later, singing along with a DJ to a selection of bad 90's pop music with the occasional 80's party jam.

Beer: Let's start with the reason you are reading this -  Beer! I am an IPA guy and as a result, I tend to lean towards the Jam Session Pale Ale, and the Hop Drop and Roll.  I'm not going to get into the different hops or the piney\/citrus flavors that these beers both contain - all you need to know is that they are both great tasting beers with an easy finish.

Parking:  There isn't much parking right there next to NODA brewery, your best bet, is to go to the big, gravel parking lot directly across the street.

Service - Service is always great.  I've never had anything less than great service here.  The bartenders are always knowledgeable about their standard and seasonal brews.

Food -  You are not going to find much in the way of food at NODA brewery.  However, there's usually a food truck parked somewhere outside of the brewery.

They were told to check it out first couple days they had it, I bugged them about it from the start ...almost for 2 months...and they DID NOTHING ABOUT IT TIL DAY BEFORE I PICKED IT UP.  All I got was a 'sorry about that' and I wasn't going to wait any longer to get back to Florida.  This is only one thing of a number of things that made me MOST unhappy with them.  I got hot water heater fixed in couple days by mobile repair guy when we got to our site in Florida.  New heater, simple fix. Premiere just didn't give a S### about it, that simple.  I will give them credit for doing a great job on axle, wheels, body that was pushing out from frame.  All done in great fashion. But be careful of so called smaller things cause they don't seem to care about them.  And make sure you get insurance check and don't pay full amount til all is done.  They work really close with insurance people so be careful...it is most helpful but can work against you so assert yourself to insurance people about check going to YOU!!!!  They will have you sign paperwork and in-bedded in paperwork is permission to cash your check without your signature, it gives them power of attorney to cash. Make sure you don't let them do this because otherwise you have nothing to control them, that was my mistake.  Bottom line is really big things get done well otherwise LOOKOUT.  They will put polymer coating on your RV for $500.00 which is a good thing but not if job is bad.  Mine was done halfway, dirt still on in places and polymer put on over. Not buffed out all over. Job done in hurry. And not in professional manner.   Not worth price paid.  should get money back for this part of work.  A shame a place with so much potential is like this.

I have been coming here for quite some time.  Normally I get helped by Tiffany  or  one of the other girls this time I walked in waited about 40 minutes to get help by Tony I asked if I could just get a fill with gel nails normally gel nails are good with just  two coats because they are supposed to dry them up with the UV light. For some reason Tony kept putting  two coats at a time and then drying them and then complaint that I was not stretching my fingers out under the UV light correctly because the paint was not drying fast enough he put on a total of seven coats and I told him that it was too many coats my nails were super thick and just look like I did them at home myself I still paid him the $30 and and told him that I was very unhappy with the nails and that they look very ugly and he just shrugged his shoulders I told him that I will not be coming back here ever and that it's a shame that he doesn't care the fact that I'm not happy with them because now I have to go and get them fixed somewhere else he shrugged his shoulders like he didn't care.

Just another fudruckers, johnny rockets, fatburger etc. All a little different but expensive for just a burger! No combo meal just a dollar off when getting fries with a burger, so everything is priced separately.

They also have Haagen Daas desserts which my girlfriend enjoyed, not something important to me though. I did like their selection of sodas, coke zero ftw

We had a large table reserved for a party. The decor was worth some discussion - we liked the crazy striped table cloths and it was overall a dark but kind of amusing atmosphere. They set the table with tortilla chips and salsa which was nice but kind of bland-like.

So after the longish wait for drinks we ordered food; I got the steak quesadilla and my boyfriend, as well as two other guests, got Fajitas.
So EVENTUALLY the food comes, and mine is.. okay, the meat is decent excepting the one piece of forgiveable cartilage, but HERE IS MY PROBLEM which resulted in two stars:

 The three fajitas came but with only two servings of tortillas and condiments. The explanation was that it was like that for ""space issues"" when there was clearly room for three helpings. But they were hungry and ate anyway, and of course they ran out of tortillas with lots of food left.
Now when each customer has paid $15\/each for their food and only two people's amount came, why is it a bother to the waitress when you ask now for the third amount of tortillas? The waitress was all snippy and wanted to know how many because they would have to charge us.

I had the strip with roasted Brussels and everything was as ordered and delicious.  My friend had the meatloaf and had zero complaints...even took home leftovers.

Out of all the times I've gone, which is about 5, my meals have lacked vegetables. Maybe one or two pieces of tiny broccoli, 3 spinach leaves, or just even a few chunks of tomato. I enjoy the vegetables and they should be present in the dish, but they aren't.

THE FOOD: With my usual craving to devour everything on the menu, it's always a challenge to decide on what to order, especially at breakfast because it's my favorite meal of the day. I ended up ordering the Cakes & Eggs Combo so I could get a little bit of everything. The eggs were cooked to perfection, and the sausage patties were flavorful. DON'T get the sausage links, the waiters\/waitresses even recommend against it, hahaha. The pancakes were really good too! The right amount of fluffiness drenched in an ocean of syrup (I did that myself, of course). 

The Cracked Egg also serves coffee cake, and it's apparently somewhat popular. I had the opportunity to eat some of this coffee cake, and it was...chocolate...coffee cake? I really don't know how to explain it any better than that. It was okay, it just tasted like a dry chocolate cake with coffee cake crumble on top. Other people have told me they have had other types of coffee cake, so I'm guessing The Cracked Egg likes to change things up. If you're curious, I would ask the staff.

The staff is another topic. I didn't think they were very friendly.

I didn't really love it because it was crowded even in the early afternoon, but I figured I would deal with it later when I was able to do more and had more time.

Josh helped us through the entire process since it was our first time there. He gave us the meat and poultry and fish samplers. The pork is delicious and soft.

For example, the croissants are the best in town. They blow away the ones from Amelies ""French"" Bakery. The FM rustic baguettes are great. The sunflower bread is fantastic. But again, it has to be proofed properly. The best bakers in that store are long gone.
There is only one item baked from scratch there, the lemon bars. They are pretty good if they are made right. And if you want a decent Cannoli, they can do it, BUT...
Do not buy the ones that are already filled (they may have been there for a couple of days). Ask them to fill the shells for you while you wait.

I have never been a huge fan of Panera because as many have mentioned its basically the Starbucks of the sandwich and soup market. Overcharging for something I can get cheaper elsewhere but if I want to be ""cool"" I have to eat at Panera. Ugh!
So, with that said, I gave Panera 4 stars. They lose 1 star for price. Thats about it from this trip that I can really knock. The service was fine, the food was delicious (I ordered a chicken sandwich that had chipotle mayo I don't remember the name), and the place is really well kept. I even had a cinnamon bun to go that was great in the morning. I really wish they would lower the prices a bit or throw in the drink with a sandwich at the least. I mean really, fountain drinks cost them a few cents. Would it really kill them to include it? For $7 although my sandwich was good it was small and I ended up eating some of my moms and my girlfriends meals too.

Not sure if I will be back but I won't be as likely to fight it next time.",3,2,0

We had an appointment to meet with Kenneth, the general manager, but his father\/owner gave us the tour. He was more interested in telling personal stories of buying the place and how nice he believes it is, than listening to our vision for our wedding day and helping us to determine how it could be realized with their venue. The venue is pretty and just as appears in pictures on their website.

After the tour, the father took us to the office where we met Kenneth, the general manager. The office smelled like a lunch cafeteria and he mentioned he just finished eating lunch. Came across unprofessional, especially because we had an appointment to meet with him and we were on time. The meeting with Kenneth was short. He provided a flyer with one wedding package on it. It was like pulling teeth to learn anything outside of that flyer. 

The site is pretty- if that is all you care about, this place may work for you. It is a family business that feels like they just do turnkey weddings. Not very personable, and we walked away feeling that they are not as customer focused as the other places we viewed. We left with a strong impression that customer service and communication, important to the trust required to plan a destination wedding, is likely to be an issue with these people.

I arrived at the airport at 4 am and tried to use the check in kiosk. It said no and directed me to the counter agent. I wait in line for ten minutes and some employee comes up and asks which flight I am there for. I tell her and she says ""It's cancelled, call this toll free number and see if they can help you"" and hands me a pamphlet. Lovely. I'm a Wind customer and was outside the Wind network so I asked if there was a phone I could use. She points to the corner and says ""there"". Uh huh.

I call the number, wait on hold for 20 minutes and am then informed I will leave three hours later and can check-in now. Oh good. I'll just hang around the airport for 4 hours with no money. It's not like my time is valuable or anything and I definitely DON'T need a beverage while I wait. I go to check in my bags and the attendant looks at my boarding passes and is like ""Just to let you know you are cutting it way too close with your times for your connecting flights."" So I'm like what the hell? Your guy on the phone set this up. She then says ""Oh, it's ok. You'll be fine."" Uh huh.

So we board the plane finally, 10 minutes late, then sit on the runway for 30 extra minutes.  Finally take off. Get to Montreal five minutes before the connecting flight is set to leave. The cabin crew reassures us there is somebody right outside the door to direct us to our connecting flights right away. Sounds good.

Of course there is no employee to direct us. We stumble around the airport trying to find our connections blindly (no gates listed on the boarding passes we were issued). Finally arrive as the plane is ready to take off. They don't let us on. Direct us to the service desk. Wait in line for 30 minutes. Finally get scheduled on another flight half an hour later. Get to Toronto over four hours late. Throughout the entire ordeal not one employee said ""Sorry"". In the extended waiting time in airports not even a glass of water was offered. Apparently Air Canada doesn't give a flying fudge stick who they inconvenience. If I'd been 4 hours late, though, you can bet they'd charge me a $75 change fee for inconveniencing them.

They should take a lesson from Via Rail, a company which also sucks, but which apologized profusely, offers free food and drinks, and issues travel credits. Freebies are nice, but not required. If the first employee had said ""I'm sorry to say that the flight has been cancelled. I know this is inconvenient but let us help you get this resolved"" my experience may have been completely different.

Oh, and I think it is completely disgusting they only allow credit cards for on-board purchases. I know more than one person who doesn't have access to credit. But they should probably just be allowed to starve because they are less than human. Mmm hmm.",7,1,1

We were scheduled in a couple hours to eat at Michael Mina's for dinner, but it was hot and I wanted ice cream. Art of Flavors had such high ratings, I had to try it and see what the hype was about!

It's a small gelato shop in a small strip area w\/ limited parking on the downtown side of vegas. It wasn't crowded when we got there, but we noticed a lot of people just dropping in to buy pints of the gelato to-go. They have so many flavors and the display is so colorful to look at. At the time we went, they didn't have some of the crazy flavors I wanted to try like FRIED CHICKEN LOL :( However, the lady who was helping us, was very sweet. She literally let us sample all the flavors we wanted lol. I love it when they do that w\/ a smile! We each got two scoops and a cookie. The cookie was just ok, but the gelato was good.

You can really taste the freshness of the gelato here, it's different than the typical gelatos you get at vegas buffets. Quality is better, but I wished it were more creamy. The portion size is a good amount, but I found that their gelato melts quickly. There were so many flavors it was hard to pick! My bf got the raspberry & coconut, it was very refreshing. I got the cookie butter and their signature fior di latte. It's a good gelato shop, but nothing TOO special.

Let's start off by saying the service was good, but the food wasn't so much. I had the Griz breakfast. Ordered it with the hash browns and got the country potatoes instead. Our waitress immediately had it corrected. However, both potatoes lacked flavor or seasoning.
The ham chunk was pretty salty, but then the bacon was ridiculously salty and the sausage was mushy texture, fatty and too much sage for my taste. The eggs ordered over medium were ok and more towards over easy, but that's ok. Oh, and then the pancakes. Well, I thought they were ok, but a bit sweet, but my wife thought they tasted too much like cake batter, and they kinda did, like sweet cream or cake batter ice cream. I'm sure that's the way they supposed to be, since they were sweet cream pancakes, but maybe a bit too rich. 
I'm a coffee snob and sold coffee commercially for many years, and I would just say their coffee was mediocre. For a place like this, they should have distinguishable coffee with a unique flavor note.
In the end, I wasn't able to choke down the sausage, bacon or too much of the ham and hash browns. Overall, just not that great as I was hoping for better.",2,1,0

They're also right down the way from Cyclebar, where I get in a couple workouts a week. I find myself grabbing a drink here every couple of rides as a treat.

Their bottled drinks are in high-quality glass containers that help to justify the $10 price tag, if knowing the details about cold-press, organic, non-HPP, etc doesn't sway you. For the quality and flavor, I'd say they're competitively priced but still remain a splurge for me. The Gin & Juice, Carrot Top, and Threesome are all humorously-named and well-balanced.

Aurochs is different than most other breweries from the standpoint that they make all of their beer from quinoa and millet.  This gives it the advantage of being naturally gluten free.  On the day that I was there they had 5 beers on tap including a blonde, a wit, an amber and a brown on both regular and nitro.  I ended up making my own sampler consisting of one of each of the beers.  All of them tasted pretty good and I was not able to tell that a single one of them were gluten free.

Book a tour in advance, this is the only way you can visit the museum. You can book student tickets online just be sure to bring your student ID with you when you visit. Our tour guide was so nice, I have her to thank for leading us to the Container Park which is located on Fremont and 7th, a five minute walk from the casino madness also on Fremont and 4th. 

Las Vegas is full of history, most of it has been forgotten due to old hotels being taken down and rebuild by new owners and developers. The folks at Neon Museum do their best in getting their hands on as many Neon signs as possible in hopes to preserve them and hopefully to restore them back to life. You'll learn all this and a lot more if you visit the Neon Museum and go on the tour. The one thing I wish was that they'll let you take photos after or before the tour, but because there are so many tours one after another they don't let you. Super clean and cute facility. 

Nevada recognizes the Neone Museum's efforts in preserving Las Vegas's history and now has their back and helps them out every way that they can. One way they help out is by renting them their land for $1 a year so they can use the money from ticketing, the gift shop, and donations towards running the museum and preserving these marvelous pieces of art. The passion and love from the entire staff is touching, you just know you're visiting a place that is important to the state. There were more locals than tourists on our tour, which tells me it has more cultural significance than tourism... you can also rent out a private lot in the back for weddings or private events. 

Tickets are extremely reasonably priced. $18 for adults and $12 for students. Parking is free. It's a private non profit.

Tips: We went on a day time tour at 3pm, we kind of wish we had booked it a little later around 4pm due to the heat. There are umbrellas they will loan you for free for your tour, you leave your ID with them in exchange. Family friendly. Only a few of the signs work at night, the photos come out better during the day time. Walk in is ok, but they recommend booking in advance, depending on how booked the tours are you could walk in and hop on a tour or they might book you for the following day.

Greeted & seated promptly & served water, along with a very small bowl of chips & salsa.

As a vegetarian, I really didn't see anything on the menu that I could eat, though my 50 year old eyes & the dim lighting made the menu a little hard for me to read.

When the server came to take out orders, I asked if I could just get some cheese & onion enchiladas, though I didn't see that listed in the menu.  With the option of several sauces -- red, green or mole, I chose mole.  Expecting rice & beans to come with it, I asked for black beans (since refried beans are normally cooked in lard) & was informed that the meals come with rice & pinto beans.

During the 15 minutes or so between our order being taken & being served, we ate about half of the chips, and all of the salsa.      There was never an effort on the staff's part to see if we'd like more of either (& yes, I would have), or if we'd liked a spicier salsa (which I would have -- what they served was good, but sweet).

Eating at a variety of Mexican restaurants pretty regularly, I was immediately surprised by the small portion of food on my plate & that of my friend.    A small quantity of Mexican rice & pinto beans were brought to us on one separate plate -- I guess we were supposed to share it, though the quantity was really just enough for one normal person.

The flavor of my food was good, and my friend loved his meal (living in the mid-west, he admitted that he can't find decent Mexican food near his home). However I left the place hungry.

What got me even more confused was when I arrived to a pub called The Monarch Tavern, not Monarch Espresso Bar. Upon entry, I was glad to find myself in the right place.

I spoke to Sarah, who told me that the ""cafe"" opened only recently in the past year within the pub. The Monarch Tavern itself is one of the oldest pubs in Toronto, opened since 1928. It is a community centre where there are ongoing events everyday for people to come in and enjoy themselves. With two floors, they have enough space to accompany the people that are attending events and those who want to drop by for a good grub and some beer (over 30 types of bourbon anyone?). They have many reoccurring events such as Choir! Choir! Choir! (on Wednesdays), Karoke Thursdays, and Vinyl Nights. For Vinyl Nights (which happens every Tuesday at 8 PM), anyone can bring in a vinyl for the pub to play and you get a free shot and drink! Yes, free alcohol, seriously. They also have a new event, which is a dance party that happens every Wednesday night along side with Choir! Choir! Choir!

I wouldn't really recommend for people to come here if they would want to study or do work. I say yes for study appropriate because it is possible, but I suggest for you to do it earlier in the day.

Lox & bagel will come with tomatoes and these tomatoes were not locally grown and I'd be surprised if they were organic. They were pink and white, paper thin and had no flavor at all. The bagel was not toasted and the cream cheese was so light and fluffy that it had hardly any flavor.

(I'm sorry, if I am paying 40k for a car, it better be in top shape!) They never got the stains out after making me wait ANOTHER two hours! The interior looked exactly the same as it did before the second cleaning. Like they just put the car behind the building for two hours.

After about a week, I couldn't figure out how to sync my phone and brought it into the service department. After all, I was promised that the car had bluetooth compatibility and voice command. This is a flat out LIE. After bringing it in, I was told my car was the basic model and there was no reason for me to complain, as I knew what I was getting into! This is ALL AFTER I WAS LIED TO! I could not believe that a business would conduct itself like this! 

That is NOT where the trouble stopped. After waiting over a month for my paperwork to register my car, I had still not gotten the call, so I called. I was told my paperwork was waiting for me whenever I wanted to pick it up. No call, no voicemail, nothing! If I had not called, I would not have known. After POLITELY telling the salesman that he should have called me to let me know that my green slip was ready, he literally shrugged and said ""Sorry, man."" I could have sworn smoke was coming out of my ears! To avoid making a scene, I turned around and left without another word. 

So we are now well into August and I registered my car, but noticed a smell coming from the air conditioner every time I turn it on. It's not just a stagnant smell, but it smells awful. Makes my entire car smell awful. Aside from this, every time my friends get in my car, they say it smells like smoke. I am not a smoker, and this car has never been smoked in. 

Then, on October 4th, I called the DMV to get an update on my title. They had NO records of my title ANYWHERE. The dealership had not even sent in my paperwork almost TWO MONTHS after I registered it. After that phone call, I made another call to Audi where the title woman told me she was ""working on your title right now."" By the end of the phone call, I made her PROMISE to send out the paperwork the following day, which was a Tuesday. 

And then today, on the 21st, I called the DMV again to get another update, and again, they had NO RECORD OF IT! Needless to say, I am fuming! I called the dealership again and was HUNG UP ON! Not only am I writing this review, I have told everyone I know NOT TO BUY A CAR FROM HERE! This is unacceptable and I cannot believe any company would treat it's customers like this.",9,0,0

To their credit, the waitress took it off of our bill (good move that will keep them under consideration for dining choices).

Some of his accessories are pricey, but they're also very high quality (I bought my wife an over-priced cat-eye LED front light for ~$60, but it's the brightest thing you could put on your bike, so I don't really regret it).

For a small shop he's got a good selection of bikes, bike parts, tools and accessories.  His bikes are also on the pricier end (he doesn't have any of the 300-500 bikes that you might find in most bike shops), but that's just because he doesn't really carry any of the low-end bikes, not because he jacks up prices.

He's also a a big fan of Canadian companies, and will always try to promote local products, which takes a lot more knowledge than someone just telling you to go buy the fanciest Italian bike on the market.

Ziggy is also not at all condescending to lower-level bike riders.  My wife is a biking novice and he treats her with the same care and attention as the cyclist who's been competing in events all his\/her life.

Everything was 5-Star.  The VERY nice thing about eating at a great steakhouse in Vegas outside of the casinos are the... WINDOWS!!!  You can see sunlight during the day!  The casinos have a lot of great steakhouses but they're usually cramped and dark.  Fleming's is large, spacious, and bright enough during the day to not resemble a Casino Dungeon.

Service is the best I've ever received at any restaurant and I travel extensively.  One waiter, two 'helpers' for water\/bread\/plate extraction, etc... and two dudes in suites checking to make sure everything is 'good'.  How can it NOT be GOOD when you have 5 people serving 4 patrons? LOL

It was Sunday night and they have an outstanding Prime Rib special which we all took advantage of (except me... I had the small Filet plate).  Prime rib, three sauces, a salad choice, one side, PLUS dessert for $35.  An incredible deal everyone in Vegas should take advantage of!!!

Their creamy horseradish sauce is very good, but not overpowering like you get in so many restaurants.  The Au Jus was typical but there was a third sauce that stood out... I don't know what it was though.  It seemed to have a Heinz 57 base but I could be wrong.

The desserts were all outstanding but what stood out was the Carrot Cake, which I normally don't even like.  It was VERY good!

I've been with Hakim for years. The last time I went in, they were very friendly and have nice, good service, and mentioned different contact options for me. They even gave me a ""trial"" pair of contact lenses free of charge when I purchased my supply.

This time, I was in a fix- I had started a new job and my insurance didn't kick in for another month. I was on my last pair of lenses, which are chipped, but I need them for work. I took a morning off of work to go and see what I could do. I explained to the girl there what my situation was (I need an eye exam, new glasses and contacts, but there is no sense paying for it all now when insurance will cover it in four weeks), and asked if I could buy a pair of individual contacts, just to get me through until I bought my new ones. She said they didn't sell them that way, and that I'd have to buy a box of each, three months worth. I explained that my prescription was almost certainly going to be changing, so I wouldn't need three months, but she said that boxes are the only way that they sell them. I asked ""please, isn't there anything I can do, just for the next month?"" She said no, and so, needing my contacts for work, I spent a hundred dollars on contacts that I will only be using for the next month. 

I know that they have the ability to give out individual contacts, because they gave them to me before, without me even asking, less than a year prior when I placed my old order. So- was the girl being deliberately unhelpful (and certainly very unsympathetic) to me, even after I explained the situation, more than once? 

If their policy had changed, and they no longer carry trial pairs, maybe it should be revisited, because my mom was in a similar situation, and her optical was able to give her a trial pair. I don't by any means think that that people should just get free contacts from opticals, obviously they are for- profit businesses, but I had been a customer for years, which I am sure they could see, and I would have been willing to purchase glasses, a full set of contacts, and get an eye exam, which they advertise that they do. Now I am most certainly not purchasing any of these items at this optical, and I would advise others from doing so as well.

Also- their sign says ""open 12-5 Sunday!"" in the window, and the previous Sunday I had tried to go around 2:30, and they were definitely closed.

Brief summary? Very disappointed, basically paid a hundred dollars for contacts I can only use for a month, definitely looking for a new optical.",3,0,0

I must admit, they make good use of the space that they do have, since some of the items are stacked along the walls (even close to the ceiling) and are hung on the sides of the store, too.  

The place has potential, although when I walked in, it seemed like there was more supply than demand.  Translation: it seemed like one of those closets where almost everything has been arranged strategically, but one false move and it all tumbles down.  Ok, maybe a bit of a stretch, but that's how I felt.

They sell a variety of items--all types of clothing (outerwear, regular clothing, evening wear, shoes, boots, scarves, wallets, sunglasses, handbags, luggage, etc)--for both men and women.  The clothing type seemed to differ, but for the most part seemed to be retro, vintage, and indie styles.  Bear with me, I'm no fashionista or anything, but they did have high-end brands and retro items.

Pros: The store has a large variety of items, and the displays seem to change regularly.  They definitely have some high-end stuff (Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Prada, etc), as well as some affordable brands (BCBG, Juicy, Bebe, etc), in addition to regularly priced\/more affordable items.  They have a mix of authentic and knock-offs, but tend to let you inspect the items or at least ask questions regarding authenticity.   
 
I've been to Buffalo Exchange, but felt like the people at this store valued me more as a potential customer, rather than assess me based on whether or not I would buy something.  The girl that was working there was very helpful and offered many suggestions or tried to point me in the right direction, at times.  

Cons: Although there are a variety of items, it doesn't seem like I was really able to find anything in my size.  I also wish that the store would've been more spread out, since they have some nice items--some of which may have been hidden--but with the way that they store is set up, it was a bit on the claustrophobic side while walking around, as there were LOTS of clothes in the store.

I was expecting a restaurant but after entering the door, there was a bar with TV and was almost confused.  Part of the restaurant looked very elegant, from the tables and chairs, and decor looking like it came from the Queens dining room.  But then part of the restaurant had a English pub feeling to it.  Another hiccup I had was the very dim lighting in the restaurant.  My stepdad had to complain to me about how he couldn't read his menu.  It could be his old age or I might have to agree that the lighting was the problem.

We sat down and since we were only looking to eat light, ordered salads.  My stepdad ordered the Iceberg Wedge.  It had, as per the menu, ""Wedge of iceberg lettuce, crispy pancetta, scallion, chopped egg, tomato concasse topped with Maria's bleu cheese dressing.  I ordered Isalata di Casa.  It's prepared, as per the menu, Endive Saald with candied walnuts, gorgonza chees, shaved pear, tossed in house vinaigrette dressing.

After we got our salads, my stepdad looked at his and looked at mine.  He looked a little disappointed and as a good daughter, I suggested we switched.  It was a little hard to part ways with my Insalata Indivia because it looked amazing.  But I wanted to make sure my stepdad had a good time.  Tasting the Iceberg Wedge, I  regretted swapping my salad instead of asking the waiter to change my order to the Insalata Indivia.  Maria's bleu cheese dressing combined with all the other ingredients was just too rich and too much to handle.  I almost wanted to throw it in the trash if there was one next to me.  There was just too much going on with the salad.  Luckily, I was able to taste the Insalata Indivia and was very impressed with it.  The colors and the flavors combined were perfect.

I brought my family of seven to the Village Inn on Stapley and Baseline.  The wait time of 25 minutes was to be expected as it was a Sunday morning.  However, when we were called in, the hostess brings us to a small table with six chairs.  I let her know that wasn't going to seat seven of us and she suggested putting two tables together.  We took our seats and the waiter comes to ask us what we'd like to drink.  My husband and I ordered a coffee and the container he brought to us that held the creamer was completely dirty and covered in grits.  It clearly hadn't been washed.  At the moment, we didn't say anything.  

We continued to wait as all of us had figured out what we were going to order and by this time, an additional 25 minutes had passed before anyone even came to check on us.  Finally, our waiter comes to our table and we mention we didn't have silverware and he walks away.  He still hadn't taken our order! We noticed that several tables around us had their orders taken.  I don't understand how he continued to miss us since we were clearly in an area that he had to walk by several times.  Another waitress came by, Brittany, about 20 minutes later to take our order, which she did. Although she was very kind we asked to speak to the manager.  In the meantime, another 10 minutes goes by and no waiter or manager is anywhere to be seen.  Brittany comes back again and gets our silverware and asked if the manager had stopped by.  I let her know he hadn't and she leaves to go get him. By this time, over an hour has passed and we still hadn't received our food, our drinks hadn't been refilled, and people that were there after us had already received their food!  Finally, I see our waiter and I was able to get his attention. 

He comes over to ask if we need anything and I told him it's been over an hour and we still hadn't received our food and he looks at me and said, ""It's busy"".  I told him other people around us that got there after us and had already received his food.  He didn't even know what to say and I told him I wanted the manager.  Finally, the manager comes by and I explain that we'd been there an hour and a half, still hadn't been served, no refills, and our container was dirty.  He said he could adjust the bill and went to check on the order.  Another 15 minutes passes and by this time, I was so frustrated I told my husband and kids to grab their things and we walked out.  

I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, but after an hour and a half, I couldn't deal with it anymore.  On top of that, their restrooms were dirty.  

The only thing that was decent was Brittany as she tried to step in and help out where she could.  For everyone else, it's clear that the food service industry is more than they can handle.  If you decide to go, hopefully you don't get the guy with the pony tail; he just doesn't know what he's doing.  I won't be back.",1,1,0

My heels are still rough despite the filing.  The toe nails are shaped differently from toe to toe (some straight with round edges, others just straight with no rounding).  The polish looks like I did it myself - it has air bubbles on one big toe and a line where she added some polish, some toes are a lighter shade (you can see the white of the nail) than the others, and there is a gap between the nail polish and the cuticles on the big toes.  I pointed out some of these discrepancies during the pedicure and they were fixed, but I couldn't micromanage the whole pedicure so I just gave up. Also note that they have no fans for drying the nails - they spray some quickdry stuff on them but this does not help them dry very quickly.  I found this out the hard way when I smudged the end of my big toe on the way home after sitting 20 minutes in the salon just to be safe.

We sat at the Dim Sum\/Noodle Bar (there's also a Taco Bar as well as regular dining tables) overlooking chefs meticulously preparing different dim sum dishes.  My wife ordered a margarita, which comes topped with a salt foam in lieu of the traditional salt-rimmed glass, while I ordered a Singapore Sling.  Both were quite tasty.

While we looked over the unique menu we ordered up some lengua tacos (don't knock 'em until you try 'em), which were one of our favorites at Oyamel (a Jose Andres restaurant in DC).  The tacos were as delicious as we remembered them.

Meanwhile, the dim sum chefs in front of us inspired us to try some lamb pot stickers which had a nice flavor highlighted by some cumin and other seasonings.  A gentleman next to us was eating some type of Chinese sandwich which looked and smelt fantastic. We decided to get one for ourselves to see if it tasted as good as it looked.  Sure enough, the Rou Jia Mo sandwich was simply awesome.  My wife and I agreed that it would make a great late night snack...especially if you had a few drinks.

The one downside about most of the dishes at China Poblano is their size.  If you go on an empty stomach, plan on ordering a few dishes.  Of course, that also means you get to try more dishes which is something I can live with.

Now that my wife and I are based on the West Coast we go to Vegas often, and now that Jose Andres has a great place like China Poblano here I'm guessing we'll be frequent visitors.",0,0,0

When I found a living social deal I jumped with joy!!!  They are always having LivingSocial deals and Groupon deals and there was no way I was paying full price.

I paid, I drove down there with a coworker who is really into NASCAR and was eager to try it out.

I have to say it was great to experience what it feels like getting into one of those cars and getting out, speeding around clinging to corners.  I can say I did it and had the experience but I wouldn't say I'll try it again.  Maybe driving it myself but never as a passenger.

First of all the drive is really short, it's a couple of laps, it flies by within minutes.  The driver wasn't that friendly, when I got in the car he didn't speak one word to me, not a hello, are you ready, not even a keep your hands in.  And according to my friend he was the same way with her too when she got her turn.  Something had happened with the walkie talkies right before our rides and I believe there were words exchanged between him and a coworker right before that put in him a bad mood.  In the drivers defense it was the other guy that I thought was being a butt head but doesn't mean the driver had to take it out on me.  We all have jobs where our coworkers can be a little sucky at times but doesn't mean you take it out on the customer.

Honestly being a passenger was boring, you're just going around in circles while a professional drives so what's scary about that.  There's no adrenaline or anything else to it.  Even if my driver was nice it still would have been boring.  Still nice I experienced it to say I did but boring.

I'd recommend if you're going to do it, just pay the extra money to take the lessons and drive the car yourself.  I just know if I would have been behind the wheel it would have been a million times better.  I use to drag race and my car wasn't as near being fast like NASCAR race cars.

WELL.. That is NOT allowed at Monta. They follow strict rules and would rather have you LEAVE than seat you at a table (that seats four people) and have your remaining party join you. 

SO in essence, if you're seated at a table with 2 extra seats you CANNOT have anyone come in and sit down and join you.

It's about time a real New Yorker like me stood up and informed everyone in the valley that this is NOT what pizza is like in New York. I think any pizza that isn't Chicago deep dish is called ""New York Style"" in the valley and I will deal with Gus' Pizza falsely claiming to be NY Style in a separate review. Venezia's pizza does have a very pleasant sauce and good tasting ingredients, but let's face it...it is RUBBERY like Domino's Pizza, even if the ingredients are a notch up. A New Yorker never eats pizza at a chain restaurant and would NEVER put up with the size and price scheme that Venezia is running. Let it be known that what Venezia calls an XL (EXTRA LARGE) pie is slightly smaller in diameter than the normal standard size pizza in NYC.  Their so-called ""Large"" pie is an insult to consumers. That is what NYC pizzeria's call either a ""small pie,"" ""bar pie,"" or ""personal pie."" I once asked for a little extra cup of sauce on the side and they wanted to charge me for it. That's the kind of utilitarian drain-every-nickel corporate chain attitude that you would NEVER see in a NYC pizzeria. Venezia's is NOT authentic Italian.

With everything I've just said, Venezia's is still probably the best pizza in the valley...THE TALLEST MIDGET IN THE ROOM in the valley of fake inauthentic overpriced ethnic food! (and by the way, it's been about 5 years since one esoteric episode of the TV show Breaking Bad used a Venezia's pizza box as a prop.

SIX pieces of steak. Count 'em, SIX! Why the difference? You tell me Black Bear. I ordered the French Dip sandwich. Nicely portioned as well but the meat was overcooked, dry and underseasoned.

I will admit getting the waitresses attention was sometimes difficult, even with there being less than 15 people in the entire place. This may have been due to the fact I was not sober.

We did order the big tall beer thingy. From what I recall it was a decent deal split among friends. But who's looking at deals when you're with a gang of cool buds, eating bar food, and playing some beer pong?!

I'd recommend dropping in with a group if its not too crowded, as there is plenty of seating\/TV's. I can only imagine it gets packed here during March Madness or regular football season.

Lindsay did all the hair and it was awesome - everyone was happy.  However, she brought someone along to do the makeup whom I had not met, and this is where I had some issues:

1. Why did I pay $40 plus tip for a make-up trial with Lindsay if she wasn't going to be the one doing my makeup on the day of the wedding, and clearly had not consulted with the makeup artist she brought about what we had discussed?  I had to find some photos to show the makeup artist.
2. The makeup artist was 5 minutes into my makeup when she asked, ""Oh, are you the BRIDE?!"" She clearly wasn't paying attention.  Also another reason I had the makeup trial - so the makeup artist would know me.
3. The air brushing.  Oh boy.  I paid $25 extra for air brushing that was supposed to last 12-ish hours.  Mine lasted four.  The problem was it has been applied much darker than my fair skin (which I didn't ask for) so when it came off I had a big tiger stripe across my breasts above my strapless gown.  They did not leave behind anything for touch-ups and I had no makeup in that dark color so I had to mix blush with powder to blend the line in.

I'm not really a person that get's sick to often and stays in and out of hospitals (Thank GOD) but I had to unfortunately utilize the ER for a tragic scorpion bite\/sting. 

Last week I contacted  the 24hr nurse line here and explained to them that I was just stung and needed advice on what to do. I've never been stung or really bit by anything other than maybe like a mosquito or something so this was all new to me. Being in as much pain as I was I needed to know a fast solution to get this taken care of. I was instructed by one of the nurses on the phone to immediately come in and bring the scorpion with me if I still had it lol. When I arrived they have this kiosk thing to sign in and put all your information in because I guess it's the new thing to feed your information to a computer instead of a human. Quiet frankly I think it's a bit lazy that these people sit at the desk and don't even help you out until all the questions are completed on the screen. 

Once I was called back the doctor came out and started the normal procedure and I guess tried to see if I was stung by one of the species that may have been poisonous. The funny\/not so funny part is that I tried to give her the scorpion that I was instructed to bring in and she looked at me like a damn fool like ""umm you brought it here""? Anyways she kind of  chuckled and said it wasn't necessary. She ordered a few shots for me and basically told me that I'd be okay since we didn't live in Arizona which houses one of the countries most dangerous species of scorpions. 

While being in the middle of shots this little lady with a computer on the cart comes to collect payment. It's crazy how they could careless about a person's condition they are more interested in the money. My insurance is great but of course like everybody else there is a co-pay.

I really enjoy The Capital Grill most times and this experience left a poor taste for the Charlotte location. Our service and the food was, at best, two-star. I know I did not have the steak but typically I can count on this chain to deliver a good meal - if not great (my last visit in Downers Grove, IL in December was fabulous).

When we were told we could not get a table for an hour we decided to sit at the bar.  After about 15 minutes the host said he could seat us - we should have been suspicious at this point. We went outside to our table that had trash and leaves around the edges of the patio (hey, wait they didn't just blow there last night).  Our tablecloth had stains and spots on the silverware. 

It took a good 15-20 minutes for our server to come take an order after bread and water were dropped. We asked to start with the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil with 12-year aged balsamic. When it arrived it was two neat stacks on one plate and one empty plate. When we asked the server why it was not split his response was ""we can't split this salad."" Ok - not as if we asked to split an escargot- the salad was almost perfectly portioned for two. Not to bother we just shared. The sliced tomatoes were mealy and flavorless and only one leaf of basil per stack. There was a nice marinated grape tomato as a garnish but I didn't pay for a tasty garnish. 

The main course we tried the grouper special. I've had better. The grouper was ok (notice the theme) but the shrimp that came with the special was overlooked and tough. Our sides - sautéed spinach and the wild mushrooms were good. We ordered a 1\/2 order of both which is just perfect for two people. My only comment is we pulled eight whole cloves of garlic out of the spinach before eating it. Vampires beware ,,,

Our drinks were never tended too and the front server never bothered to follow up on the salad. I hope everyone inside had a better experience.",0,2,0

Getting the food out was just as slow. We had seen the great reviews about the brisket. So we ordered the brisket dinner, and the super sampler with pulled pork, hot link, brisket, and the dry ribs.

The ribs were the best part of the meal. The pulled pork came in second, then the hot link, and finally the brisket in dead last. Perhaps I'm a little picky of my brisket, but I expect bark and a wonderful smoke ring and smokey flavor. The ring was barely there. The brisket was so lean it had no flavor and was not very tender.

Sides we had okra, potato salad, fried corn on the cob, and Cole slaw. The corn tasted old, the Cole slaw and potato salad was no different than something I'd get in a grocery store deli. The okra was the only thing that shined. My southern bell wife devoured it.

Moving on, I dropped in this place when they first opened and later left since it was cash only at the time.

So I managed to return with the main squeeze since she recommended trying the place out, why not?

Do keep in mind that there is a small parking lot at the rear that can be tricky with people coming and going, so be careful when exiting to the street.

There was a 5 minute wait, which I told myself must be a good sign.  Once seated, we were sharing a large table with another group separated with a makeshift partition that was also a special menu.  Kinda like a science project board or something of the sort.

Anyhow, I read on Yelp that a lot of people enjoyed the Killer Spicy Ramen A.K.A. Screaming for Vengeance...so I had to give it a try, in shoyu broth.  Apparently they offer shio (salt), miso (fermented bean), and shoyu (soy sauce) broth...I wish they had kotteri.  In addition to that, my girl got the Deluxe Miso Ramen while I added a Curry Chashu Bowl, Gyoza and tall Kirin Ichiban draft beer.  What's puzzling to me is that if this type of ramen originated from Hokkaido, why isn't there Sapporo on tap?

It didn't take long for the food to come out and began nibbling on the Curry Chashu Bowl immediately.  Its yummy but was quick to notice that their chashu is doesn't melt in your mouth like it does at Monta.  It is, in fact, very similar to Fukimimi Ramen chashu, a little bit chewier but there is a grilled or smoked flavor that was received very well.

When the ramen arrived, like all soups, I like to take a second or two to taste the broth by itself before loading up any condiments or additives.  I was surprised to learn that the broth was not that spicy, given the name...it was more like whispering for vengeance.  I was praying that it was a creeper and would live up to its name, but unfortunately that never happened.  Thick ramen noodles were included versus Monta and Fukumimi, which is not a bad thing for me.  If I had to choose, ranking would be Monta, Ramen Sora, then Fukumimi, when it comes to ramen noodles alone.  I am not sure if it is handmade here either.

The ramen was pretty disappointing and tasted very much like a mad scientist concoction of instant ramen packets with a heavy dose of togarashi.  My girl was not very please with her ""Deluxe"" as well and we decided to get it over with and get our fill before heading over to the Ice Skating Yelp event at the Cosmo, thanks Misti Y. for the free tickets...well Darlene R. thanks you, she was the Elite member to receive them.

I left the place full and can admit that the only good thing in the ramen is the red fishy chili oil sauce used to garnish the bowl of ramen, other than that, probably will have to rank  this near the bottom of the pack in terms of ramen.  Some  katsuobushi, wakame or togarashi would be nice too.  I still want to come in for the butter corn ramen since it was my initial pick.  So lesson learned, go with your instinct Yelpers.  LOL.

Oh yeah, another thing, when it comes to ramen and pho, I came to notice a lot of people are very particular to certain flavors, so much of this is to each his\/her own.  I like to do research on the whole culture to know what I am searching for in good ramen or pho.  Also, forgot to mention that those that like ramen may want to try Taiwanese and Chinese noodle soup as well...Wendy's Noodle Cafe & Yi Mei Champion Taiwanese Deli.",2,1,1

But we don't go to Strip places very often unless we have a reason.  We finally did:  a new show with comp tix at Planet Hollywood, and two hungry Yelpers not wanting to wait to eat after the show ended.  Perfect match.   

Hubby and I both decided to order the same sandwich, pastrami, which doesn't let me write an extensive review of the food.  It was a good sandwich, very lean pastrami, but not all that plentiful.  The reported swiss cheese wasn't noticeable.  That was okay with me: I don't like swiss cheese, but didn't change it because to my way of thinking, cheese on a pastrami sandwich is sacrilegious.

Strip prices being what they are, though, I guess it was as much as we should have expected, because this was  reasonably priced based on Earl's location.  The bread?  Good, now that I've all but given up hope of ever finding a sandwich on a crisp baguette in Las Vegas.  I'll have to go back to the east coast for that bit of heaven.

We also ordered a bowl of tortilla soup.  I didn't want to, since I learned only after asking that it's a cream soup.  Rule #1:  authentic tortilla soup does not contain cream.  Rule #2:  I should not eat creamed soups.  They're bad for me.  And for my husband.  But he's not as much as a stickler for the rules as I am, so I let him get it after learning - again only after asking - that the tomato soup was also CREAM of tomato.  So much for healthier alternatives.  Would it be so hard to write that on the chalkboard these soups were listed on?  Having said that, it was a very tasty soup, as long as I didn't tell myself that it was tortilla soup (See Rule #1 above).  

In sum, Earl of Sandwich is a decent place if you're a tourist in LV on a budget.  For us, we're not likely to feel the urge to return unless we're at PH again for some reason and in a hurry.",3,2,2

Not only did they perform the required repairs for a fraction of the dealer's price but they also replaced a bunch of other maintenance items at the same time and I still ended up paying way less than the dealer quoted. 

They took the time to discuss and explain the whole service with me before hand and the communication stayed up while they did the repairs.  Their familiarity with Audi's was reassuring and I will be bringing my cars back to them in the future. (Not too soon though, I hope)

You see doorways and Bosnian artifacts. It's sort of like Disney Land. The menu is very meat and bread heavy so you have to plan for that. I had a chicken sandwich made with their house made bread. The bread was unlike any bread I had before and had a similar texture to a fluffy glazed donut and was tasty but a little greasy. My chicken was pounded very thin but was tender, juicy and seasoned well. I had added mushrooms and ajvar (roasted red pepper and eggplant condiment) to my sandwich. The ajvar seemed fresh made and was very mild. They gave me a generous amount of mushrooms that lacked caramelization. The sandwich was tasty but is a lot of bread so I ate it open faced so I wouldn't eat too much bread.

My husband had a cup of bean soup that was very porky and the popular spicy beef sausage sandwich. The sausage is skinless and is spicy but not very spicy. 

Since it was our first time here our waitress wouldn't let us leave without trying a Bosnian Candy. She gave us a chocolate covered candy that looked like a banana. It tasted like a banana flavored circus peanut that was chocolate covered.

There's something for everyone here.  It's a fairly level hike for a good part of the way so it's fine for dogs and kids.  After crossing the wash from the parking lot, simply follow the trail as it meanders toward the canyon.  After the waterfall, there are several routes you can take.  You can stay in the wash when it's dry and do some rock scrambling and boulder hopping.  This is a slower way but it's a lot more challenging.

If you want to go a little easier on yourself, follow one of the trails out of the wash on the south side of the canyon and hike the use trail until you a forced back into the wash.  If you want, you can keep going and end up in Pahrump if you really want to.

The rock scrambling and boulder hopping are good fun but you should only do this if you're wearing hiking boots so you have the proper traction on what can be slick rocks.  Sneakers just don't do it sometimes.

Give First creek a try.  I think you'll like it, too.",17,5,8

This event was pretty popular so the line ups to food and drinks was long. 5-10mins of waiting. There was a rock band performing (I wasn't really into it bc it sounded sad) and after 10pm there was a DJ playing techno like. 

The theme was fashion. there was a projector projecting fashion show clips onto the wall. And there was a display of chucky like dolls in very fashionable clothes. It look sort of creepy to me.

This should be my favorite place in Las Vegas: Artisan Burgers and amazing beer both local and foreign. Even the service was grand. What went horribly wrong? There are two factors that make this place a definitive nope: one is the price of everything is out of touch with reality. Sure this is in the Mandalay Bay on the strip, but it's actually in one of those weird connector mini-malls we have so many of. This is a very nice retail passageway, but it's not actually Mandalay Bay proper. Even if it were I am sure I could find a greater value in food virtually anywhere else in the Mandy.

The problem isn't just the prices, which are certainly atrocious, it's just that the burgers aren't good. I had the Hubert Keller signature burger. It wasn't great. The meat wasn't particularly flavorful,  the red wine and shallots sauce was vinegary and the side of the chipolte aioli was bland and seemed old. The Buffalo was dry the previous time I came here and I chalked it up to being the nature of the meat. It's not, I've had spectacular buffalo since and much better value.

The beer list is utter torture. It's glorious in it's depth and yet should anyone actually pay those prices they should immediately be carved into servings and fed to starving African Children. A handy strip mark-up is one thing, within reason. But charging eight times retail for a beer readily available at local gas stations almost almost makes me want to go all Reductio ad Hitlerum up in this review. I scoured the beer menu and could not find a purchase I was willing to make. I cannot remember the last time I went to a restaurant such as this and just had a soda. I actually did not purchase a beer.

If you can afford this place go to a burger restaurant that actually has decent food. Better yet check out é by josé andrés and save a few bucks.",2,3,1

Thankfully, this place has nothing to do with the Chinese, so I can claim the former. Because it was the nearest bar to my hostel, this was the first place I visited in Edinburgh and (because I'm a tight bastard of a Northerner) was aghast when I handed over £6.40 for 2 Guinness! How naive I was... It turns out this place is cheap!

I saw it both packed and dead to the world. Mostly the former, and as there's two pool tables taking up half the floor, you're most likely to find you've stood somewhere where you're going to be accosted by a drunk Antipodean with a pool cue in his hand asking you to ""move, mate"".  

Ah, that was it. If the bar were Vanessas Feltz and Aussies her food, her gastric band would have burst years ago. This place is packed with them! (I'm including Kiwis, South Africans and Tasmanians in that because it doesn't matter if you raise your vowels in a different way - you're effectively the same.) Why? I haven't got a clue.

We didn't know where or what we wanted to eat and down there, there are more than a few options to pick from.  Dizzy from all of the choices (and perhaps low blood sugar), we walked past Deluca's.  My PIC commented on the fact that he heard that place was ""good"" and it was featured on the Food Network.  He had me at ""good"" (granted, I don't watch Food Network).  Anywho, apparently we got there at just the right time between breakfast and lunch because we got seated immediately.  We were greeted by a detached if not surly waiter.  He was efficient in taking our orders and getting our food.  Unfortunately, we never saw him again after that (except to get our bill of course).  

Despite the mediocre service, the food iteself was excellent.  The true diner menu, with its seemingly hundreds of selections, had a breakfast highlight as all diners do.  My PIC and I happily obliged the menu and ordered two different breakfasts.  I got the biscuits and sausage gravy and he got a breakfast with gigantic pancakes.  The portions were huge and the food was tasty.  The people next to us had breakfast burritos that made our breakfasts look puny in comparison.  Or maybe it was me being star struck by the ""Tom Cruise's ass was here"" plaque.  We agreed that our next trip would include those (burritos, not Tom Cruise). 

Unfortunately, the last time my PIC and I tried to go to Deluca's, there was a line around the block.  We didn't feel like waiting, so we went elsewhere.  I do have to say though, that I wish we had waited in line for Deluca's instead of going ""elsewhere"".  That's a regret I will take to my grave.  Just wait in line at Deluca's.

I feel like I was suckered out of my application fee, because she told us, from the first phone call, that my Biltmore Properties housing voucher was no problem. That seemed to actually be true. My rental agent was very forward with these people with regard to my rental debt (I have a judgement). 

After we got there, and they still had $55 to make by exploiting my bad circumstance, they continued to insist that I had nooooo worries. There was nooooo problem. I gave them the application fee (one of the biggest rackets in the US today) and the application was complete, things changed... 

Suddenly, I had to pay an additional deposit. 

Okay, that's understandable. The debt was only a year old. So, I gave them $100 to hold the apartment.

2 days later, I called (after leaving several messages and having none of then returned) and suddenly! 

...I now need a cosigner. That was very, very difficult. It was also doable. I asked my Mom if she would cosign for me, and she agreed. So, finally, everything was set up, and of course, they are familiar with how a BPI subsidy works. They are aware that there would be no time for me to make a change, and Autumn and Jasmine assure me 5 separate times (which I recorded--yes there's an app for that) that although I hadn't gotten the link to sign the lease in the one day she had promised, obviously realize by my tone and level of concern on all of those inquiries by phone. You can tell that they understand the implications for me should I have to find another place to move this late. 

You can tell! They reassure me each time, once even telling me not to worry, because I'm in 'good hands' now.

Then, today, 3 weeks following the date of application, after I had gathered the cosigner and the additional deposit, and after going through all the leg work and the red tape and paperwork (takes about 3 weeks so I began looking early, had plenty of time...) to get the property funded for the whole cost of the move in, and having the check 2 days from being on the way to their hands, and after comforting me while I wasted all the time I had to locate an apartment, Jasmine called me today and drops the hammer. 

My apartment is now no longer available to me, and they don't know what to say. They do not mind that I will be on the streets with no place to go, and recovering from an attack on my leg in September that left me unable to stand on it for longer than a few minutes at a time. 

I now have to vacate my apartment that I'm currently in, because it's already rented, and there is no concession that they are willing to make for me. 

Wow. 

I think that a court is going to see it differently, but that does not help me now. My name is Tami Nelson, and I'd like to rent a 1bedroom apartment, so if you won't rob me, and fool me out of my time, please give me a call! Send me an e-mail! My move in date is May 31. Please help me, because these people have made it so that I have no time to look, and I'm going to lose all my things. 

I had the movers scheduled, the check cut, and Jasmine smashed my hope to bits. I'm so wounded that I'm sitting on the floor, having missed physical therapy, begging Jesus for an answer.

I came here with a few friends and this was the first time any of us has every been to any of the Grimaldi's locations.

We went with a large house salad: Romaine lettuce, red onions, cherry tomatoes, oven roasted sweet red peppers, mushrooms, olives, and Vinaigrette dressing ($8), a large white w\/ garlic pizza with meatballs and mushrooms ($22), and two Cannolis ($4.50 ea.). 

The salad came out in a bowl that was just big enough to fit the portion of salad in it, so it looked like there wasn't much salad at first, but there was actually more than enough for all four of us. I guess I'm just so used to places putting salad in oversized bowls that I don't realize what the ""right"" amount looks like. We each had at least 2 servings each and there was still some leftover. The salad was very fresh and I really enjoyed the mushrooms and Vinaigrette dressing. It's not too often that I have salad with mushrooms in it. The pizza blew all of us away. The crust was very thin, but not dry or overcooked. There were also a lot of garlic bits on top, but it surprisingly didn't bother any of us. It also had a pretty good amount of mushrooms on top, which I loved.

Our waitress was always checking up on us and refilling our drinks throughout our time here and she would even give her recommendations, tell us a little bit about the different menu items, and even joke around a little. It really added to our experience here.

The food was over prices and tasteless.  My husband had the filet $54.  it was drowning in a horrible brandy sauce.  It was possibly the fattiest steak i have ever seen, especially for a filet.  Over half was left over due to the fat that was cut away.  The Creamed spinach was OK.  But $10 for a vat of it.  it would be nice if they had single servings.  I had the tasting menu, $85.  The lobster bisque was ok but too rich.  The Crab cake was over powered but a papaya slaw (the papaya clearly out of season as it was bitter and rancid tasting).  The Fish... OMG, the fish... it was completely tasteless. Then my filet... yuck!  it came with a side of Potato Au Gratin with tasted like paste.  again my steak was drowning in a sauce with onions that we inedible.  Finally time for dessert... it was a trio of desserts (banana pudding, some chocolate tradgedy and raspberry whipped cream).  My husband took a bite of the banana pudding and described it as ""flour mixed with snot"".  Our Bill was over $200 and that did not include wine.

I went today with him and a few others to give this place a shot, and we were all quite surprised.  I didn't really expect it to be so good.  I ordered the Goat Curry with Jamaican Roti, and the Sweet Potato Pudding for dessert.  

I have yet to have a goat curry that I have really liked.  The dish in general always seems to be served with a sweet yellow Indian curry, which I'm not a huge fan of.  This curry was different.  I loved it.  It wasn't sweet at all, nor made with coconut.  It had a perfect spicy flavor without going over the top.  There were little potatoes in it, along with very tender and moist stringy goat meat.  The roti was amazing... very flat, floury bread with a little bit of spice cooked into it, perhaps from a curry.  I dipped it in my curry sauce, and thoroughly enjoyed every bite.  There was also a little coli flower salad that came with the dish, and a whole wheat bun.  

The Sweet Potato Pudding caught me off guard.  I didn't really taste a lot of sweet potato in it, but did taste perhaps a little rum or something like that.  It had raisins in it too, and was more of a little pudding cake.  It was quite enjoyable, but after all of the food that we had, i just couldn't finish it!  

We also had some of the beef and chicken stuffed patties.  You HAVE to try the beef patties.  They are spicy with shredded beef stuffed inside a layered pastry.  Just deliciousness.  When I come back, and I definitely am, there is simply no way I could not order one of these on the side.

Personally, I think the reviews on this place are low.  The ambiance isn't much; it fees like a mom and pop diner.  The staff offers adequate service, but isn't overly friendly.  The place is just very casual.  However, I think the food is quite a bit above average.  The prices are slightly high, but if that bothers you just drink a water and don't order any extras.  The food is worth it.  I don't really like sweet Indian curry, so this curry has me hooked!  I can't wait to try the ox tail!",8,1,5

The first time we ate here, I was kinda skeptical about the whole concept: a Chipotle of pizza, right?  Well, after devouring my first 180-second fired pizza, I became a Blaze believer.  First of all, the price is right for the Build Your Own Pizza, where you can add as many toppings as you want for $7.65.  Their Signature Pizzas, where the ingredients are already laid out for you, are also only $7.65.  I like the Veg Out, Red Vine, and the White Top for these.  Secondly, well, the pizza comes out fast!  And, thirdly, they are delicious, not at all greasy. 

This location is only two exits away from us so it makes it easy to get here and get our Blaze fix, which we've been doing at least once a week now.  The staff is super friendly and even if there's a line, it moves fairly quickly, plus you know your pizza will be ready in no time.

However, milk tea shaved ice isn't available in cha me cha. My friends ordered the regular milk teas with boba - nothing too unique. My friend ordered shaved ice with mango chunks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The following night, I was hanging out with my married friend Steve.  We met up with a couple friends of mine at this British pub in Phoenix.  The night was going well and since we were on that side of town, I suggested going to Burn since I had heard it was the hot shit place to be.  I texted a few people to try and make it a group thing - the replies I got were ""Burn? That place is GAY!"" - I naturally assumed they meant that it sucked, but since I hadn't been there I figured I might as well check it out in spite of the snobby review.
 
One of the people in my party even agreed with my text saying - 'yeah, I heard that place was pretty gay.'  Again, I wasn't interested in hearing the nay-sayers say 'nay'.  I'm not going to form opinions on something like this without first hand experience... I'll decide how gay (lame) it is on my own, thanks.  In spite of this, I got us all to agree to mosey over to Burn to check it out since none of us had been there.
 
The couple we were with arrived first and told us they went to the bar next door instead because Burn had a cover.  Steve and I met them for a drink and then decided we wanted to go next door to check out Burn anyway since we had come this far.  At least we were going to see what the cover would be...
 
We walk in the doorway and Steve goes - ""dang, this place is pretty gay..."" to which I inquired if he didn't just want to leave.  Before I could finish my question, he said - ""eh, let's just check it out anyway.""  As he says this I cast my gaze inside the club for the first time to see go-go dancers on platforms... and I'm talking about buff shirtless and hairless dudes in tighty whiteys, cowboy boots and cowboy hats.  Apparently, when my friends were saying ""that place is gay"" - they meant homosexual... Saturday night is gay night.  I am dumb.
 
Before I could say ""let's just get the fuck out of here,"" Steve had paid for both our covers and was making a bee-line for the bathroom (what the fuck is it with making a bee-line for a bathroom in a gay bar?  That's the last place I'd want to be)... I followed him with a hasteful step and stopped outside the bathroom door and planted my back firmly against a wall - again trying to avoid surprise attack anal rapes on my virgin bottom.
 
I take this moment to myself to scan the room and the people in it - mostly dudes... it looked like my gym - everyone was buff and chiseled and model-like.  People seemed to indiscriminantly smack each other on the butts or grab each other in the crotch as they walked by.  After about a minute of this, I text Steve saying ""Fuck this.""  He calls back to tell me he's out on the front patio.  I don't know how he fucking snuck past me, but I met up with him outside. 
 
We both agreed that the gay people at this joint were way more intense than any collective of gay people we had seen before.  Even the lesbians were intense.  Everyone looked both attractive and tough as fuck.  We both kinda felt a sense of danger - we thought we were at risk of getting beat up for being straight. Perhaps this is how isolated gay guys feel in a straight world.  Steve went off to get us drinks and I caught eyes with some straight girls who motioned me over to their table.  After a talk and a drink, Steve and I split.
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We discussed the fact that while we weren't the best looking guys in that place by any stretch - we would probably do well in there if we wanted to hook up with a guy.  Somehow we manage to always include this concept in our conversations - how many people we could get to 'do us' if we wanted.
 
There were crossdressers at this place too.  I was under the assumption that crossdressing doesn't amount to gay necessarily... I mean, if you're gay - why would you want someone that looked like the opposite sex?  I suppose I don't quite understand the concepts or the mechanics fully.  Perhaps it's just because there's no good tranny bars in the valley.
 
After leaving Burn, we were headed to another bar and walking down the street when from a block behind us we heard faint cat calls.  We muttered to each other not to turn around and to ignore it.  Again we heard them and this time we were sure they were directed at us.  ""Hay boyz... wanna taste my meat"" or something of that nature.  Finally we got brave and turned around to discover it was my friend Ryan whom we thought had left already.  I think we both were fearing some sort of brutal reverse gay bashing.... ""Phoenix: where the gays bash you.",1,1,1

I live about a mile and a half from school, and needed to go home from school. Well, the cab driver was already there when I got out of school, which was a huge plus. He asked where I needed to go, and I told him. He did not plug it into a GPS. He went past the light where he was supposed to turn at and proceeded to turn left instead of right, into a residential neighborhood. I live in an apartment. Then, after figuring out his mistake, he again went to another residential neighborhood on the right side of the street and asked if a house was my apartment. Let me just add that it reeked of weed inside this cab, but I thought it was probably just a previous passenger. Now, I was thinking maybe it was him. After 15 minutes of driving, which  normally takes my fiancée five minutes, he found where I live. He charged me the full $10.95, which I should not have paid. I hoped I wouldn't have to pay it because he swiped my card ten times (his swiper was broken). He said previous customers had hard times too. I also did not see a selection for no tip, so I had to leave a $2 tip. I tried contacting Discount Cab on their website, but it kept saying ""error"".

but things are just not right at the Astor House--we ate there last night on Halloween.  What a missed marketing opportunity--Trick and Treaters kept stopping by --we heard many saying we had no idea this place was here.  instead of handing out a coupon for a macaroon with lunch--the staff did nothing and were actually kind of funky when people walked in.  

The Astor House needs to get an identity--the ""service"" is just funky--neither a cafeteria nor service--you would think with 4 people in the restaurant--you would not have to go to the end of the counter and pick up your ""tray"" of food.  the tables are wobbly and the chairs are uncomfortable--things that I wouldn't care about if the food was good.

On to the food--I may have a bias because I spent a lot of time in Kansas City and know what good barbecue is--what is being served is not.  the meat continues to be dry and the sauces are yucky--they are two sweet or weirdly spiced.--the one highlight was the link--chicken and garlic was good.  The food is served in paper on trays--all i can say is yuck!--we had to ask for paper plates--which at least made the eating process tolerable..

the Astor House is in a great neighborhood--but even the neighbors who can walk there are either going to go to the Tuck Shop or walk a few more blocks to 7th st to restaurants that have much better food.

I will definitely be back to the Tuck Shop over and over again, but am done with the Astor House--have been there several times--and it is just not right--they need to find out what the neighbors want and be that--coffee, sandwich, drinks and snacks--do --something well and be at the level of the Tuck Shop instead of a pretend cafeteria--

The store is huge to be sure, but once you get to know your way around, it is easy to zip through the store and get everything you need. It is a clean, well organized grocery store. 

My review is of the take out prepared foods.  I love the weekly deal they offer in the Giant Eagle grocery paper. I also like the salad and hot food bar. I have yet to try the sushi. I can see it being prepared in front of my but still a little leery of getting my favorite food from a grocery store.  

Today I tried the homemade soups. Wedding and a Chicken Pot Pie.  I liked the soup but won't try it again, maybe something different like; Potato or broccoli or the bisque. The soup was good, but was lacking flavor.  I did not heat in the microwave as they suggest, instead I emptied the container in to a pot and heated on the stove. I don't like to microwave if I don't have to. 

The Pot Pie was good also, plenty of shredded chicken and vegetables. It had a bland gravy to it. I was hoping to get something ready and not have to add any ingredients to it. I got the pot pie cold to heat up once I got home. I set the oven to 350 for about 20mins. 
I would recommend it for those to try. I am not going to not shop prepared foods because of the less then great experience, just try something different. 

I do recommend !",0,0,0

As Nina P. Who I think is the manager who was off that day that we had an appointment and in her reply she said ( They will use it to improve for future services!!...) 
I strongly suggest that being a little bit more honest will go along way! 
When we made a appointment for the first time and we were not able to make it, we called and canceled our appointment because we respect the business! And maybe someone is looking for an appointment however we made another appointment to be there at 5 PM the next day. Everyone in the world cancels appointments for a reason, whether it be personal or professional.
We were exactly on time!! No one came up to the front door to ask us when did we have a appointment! Everyone was sitting and still working on other peoples hand & feet so we had to wait an extra 20 min and also there were two people ahead of us sitting on the bench. After 20 min wait there was only one person available and we had appointment for two people!! We decided to walk out because of the rude behavior and poor customer service, not telling people that you only except cash and changing the prices as you wish!
I guess now we understand the meaning of appointment! Also it's OK for the business to make people wait extra 20 minutes or 3 1\/2 hours for other people that had appointments which everyone can find on the other reviews.Calling and canceling the appointment is very disappointing! I guess if you have a emergency. No matter what the situation would be or is (Customers is always right!) replying false information to customers with a rude tone won't help the business and all!

First, the wait staff is top notch, so this is no reflection of the amazing and friendly service that they offer. 

The Turf has just made menu changes- and not for the better; some observations: first, restaurants that make drastic changes often times alienate their current clientele- that's my prediction for The Turf because a lot of the menu was scrapped I'm sure for someone's ""vision"" of what they should be serving. No one asked me my opinion about menu offerings, etc as a regular customer and I'm assuming that actual customers were never surveyed about the menu. If I was the owner, I'd ask my long time staff (w\/out management present so that you can get the real story) as to the customer feedback.  That is if it's worth keeping a lunch or dinner service going.

I'm not sure why certain menu offerings were eliminated. From my observation, this place doesn't get a big dining crowd for lunch or dinner, so making menu changes isn't the issue necessarily or the quick fix as far as why people aren't eating at The Turf- it's likely just a lack of top of mind awareness as a viable lunch or dinner option (a lack of promotions, marketing or advertising). Therefore, changing the menu dramatically doesn't make really make  sense. Having been in the restaurant business, it's better to make small changes gradually, based on actual consumer feedback.. Things I miss: club sandwich (the traditional style), steak fries (they were awesome), rolls w\/salads (no longer), excellent wraps, etc... I'm sure there are more changes that other customers are unhappy with.

Also, The Turf has off-track betting, and I""m sorry, attracts a somewhat sketchy crowd that lingers in front or near your table at times, watching monitors overhead, to follow their horse bet. They even have a booth upfront manned by a woman who's never friendly to diners. It's a very unsavory element of this pub.  I think that's probably the biggest reason you don't get a bigger lunch or dinner crowd (not very classy, although I've grown to ignore that part of the atmosphere). With that element there, that probably won't change.

Also, kitchen service is really slow over the last month. For years, this was a great place to come for a quick lunch- order, get your food in 10 minutes, etc... Today's lunch in total took 1.5 hours.  Operational issues and I'm assuming a new cook.

Consistency lately with the food hasn't been great. My friend always orders a salad, and sometimes it's a lot of salad, and sometimes it's less salad. And, again, no complimentary roll that always came with the salad.

Secondly, As a place to drink, it's still a great pub. PS: One major positive change is that they no longer are playing Irish music. Seriously, other than St. Patty's, most Irish in Ireland don't listen to that music!

Good luck guys! Thanks for the memories!",2,0,0

Anyway, I call over 3 hours after I dropped him off and they tell me that they are just finishing him up.  I immediately go pick him up.  Before they let me see my dog, they have me pay.  I paid with my debit card and before she ran it she asked me how much of a tip I would like to leave the groomer.  I hadn't even seen the job the groomer did yet and they ASK for a tip... WTF?  Rude.  I tipped  because I had no cash, but it would be nice if I could have seen him before making that choice.
When he came out, he seemed very withdrawn... not his normal self.  I took him home and noticed his dew claws hadn't been touched!  I took him back and they fixed the problem....but, really?  It should have been done the first time.
The whole rest of the night, my dog was very lethargic and not himself.  I was quite concerned about his behavior.  I'm wondering if they gave him some kind of drug while he was there.

Also, very loud and hard to carry on a conversation.  This will probably be very different when it's warm outside and the ""garage doors"" are open letting it be an open air bar.

I ordered the sliders and the bitterballion and was not impressed with either.  The sliders were overcooked and very dry.  Even the potatoe bun was dry and hard.  The sandwiches had very little flavor.  The bitterballion at first bite was good, but after one, they were way too salty.  The sauces served with them did not have much flavor.  I had the garlic aiola and was not impressed.  We actually commented to the server our distate for both items, and we did receive a free dessert.

My friends had the salmon, a chicken burger and a wrap, and they were all pleased with their entrees.  All of them had beer with their meals, and were shocked at the amount of foam that was served on each beer.  The pours did not fill the glasses and the foam was excessively high.  They were all commenting on the pours.  I had a Bacardi and diet, and must say, I could barely taste the Bacardi in the drink.  Must have been a lite pour.

As I said we received a free dessert because of our comment on the appetizers.  It was a brownie with salted carmel pretzel icecream.  I'm not a fan of desserts, but it was a good dessert.  Very flavorful!

Eventhough I was not impressed with my appetizers, I must say the service was amazing.  The staff was constantly filling the water glasses and coming by routinely to see if we needed anything.  Our server was very friendly and outgoing.  The only negative here, was that those bringing beer\/drinks to the table had difficulty in locating which table the beverages were supposed to go to.

We did walk upstairs and outside and found an amazing deck!! Can't wait to go back when it is warm and try the outside deck.  It would probably be beneficial to have a bar on the deck since it is so large.  Outdoor firepits or heaters might also be an option, as had they been out there tonight, people probably would have been out there since it was in the low 60's\/upper 50s.

The teriyaki chicken was very dried out and the combo fried rice with pineapple and cashews was not what would be considered fried rice and was pretty flavorless.

There is nothing remotely Japanese about this restaurant. The decor so perfectly captures the suicidal ambiance of a small town casino, and the patrons hold little distinction to the picture our minds paint when imagining gambling addicts. It may be harsh to suggest that Yuki's food render its customers to the vegetative state of addicts, but the truth is you'd have to be stubbornly mindless to be a regular here. The frog lady waitress (and probably owner) serving you your food looks like she jumped out of a Tarantino movie--if Tarantino ever made a slasher film based around a grimy restaurant--gliding across the restaurant while dragging her feet in exhaustion--she took my order with the enthusiasm of a potato.
Miso soup, green dragon roll, chicken katsu bento box, and a cup of tea.

As I looked around at the sad faces at this restaurant I began feeling sorry for myself. Not for any particular reason, I suppose I was simply blending in.

My miso soup arrived and I grabbed the bowl and lifted it to my mouth. Just then, something fell to my crotch from the bottom of the bowl. I assumed it to be a cracker of some sorts and continued to gulp my soup down. But I didn't order anything resembling of a cracker, or bread, or anything crackerbread in colour. I put down my soup bowl and reached for the mysterious object. The soft, warm and wet texture registered only when I held it close to my face to examine it closely. The hairs on my body erected as if it was trying to jump from my skin, and the goose bumps sent a rush of sheer chill of disgust down my spine when I realized I was holding somebody's freshly chewed gum between my fingers. I immediately stuck it under the table next to me, but the sticky substance clanged on in a stringy stretch of grossness resembling a hot slice of cheesy pizza being pulled away from the pie. I wiped my fingers on every surface trying to rid of the horror from my hands. No one noticed my silent horror episode. I sat in my seat panting for air, and holding back the scream that was desperately trying to escape me.

I sat in my seat in silence as if the rest of the world did not exist. When I snapped back to reality, my food was already sitting on my table. I completely missed the frog lady bringing me my orders. Never has a bento box and a sushi platter struck more fear into my heart. Two girls came through the doors, and immediately I saw them not as patrons, but victims. Victims of the health code violations and unsanitary conditions of this wretched restaurant. I wanted to warn them. I wanted to jump from my table and rush the girls out of the restaurants and run far far away. Instead, I just sat in my seat shell-shocked. Post-traumatic stress syndrome from a sushi restaurant.

I ended up finishing all my food with disdain, promising I would tell the world about this place. The truth is, I grew up in worst conditions. I've ate in lesser places. But this is Canada, and I am allowed to be disgusted and lie to myself about living in Toronto where there is a delusion of standards!

The avocado tasted a days' old, the miso soup tasted of preservatives, and the eel fish had the texture of the days' old avocado. I welcomed myself to the worst restaurant experience of my entire life, and now I see the world like a veteran of war after having served my time and ate my dues at Yuki's revolting Japanese Ya. I assume 'YA' is the sound you'd make when you discover the quality and sanitary conditions of this place

Pros:  The room was fantastic; exactly what we were looking for with a view of a significant portion of the strip, including the fountains at the Bellagio next door.  Two spacious showers, large televisions, and a well furnished and comfortable balcony.   The hotel itself is exceptional.  Excellent pools, very clean casino, good floor staff, and a good layout.  Cleaning staff was friendly and in-and-out of our room the moment we would leave.  Security was awesome - our keys turned off on the last night and security was up to help us within three minutes (timed it).

Cons: Check-in staff was abysmal.  First, the booking was duplicated in their system with the wrong room type and duration.  After correcting the tenure of the stay, we were promptly checked in to the wrong room.  More confusion from the staff, and then a very competent manager was able to resolve the issue in five minutes (after we played around with the regular staff forever) and get us the right room.  When we went by to get our luggage from the bellhop, they suggested we just give them the room number and they'd have it right up.  Two hours and three phone calls later, we just went back down and grabbed it up ourselves.  Conversations with other guests revealed similar experiences and the supposition that they were just overwhelmed that day.

Neutral:  As mentioned in other reviews, there is a significant population of young party people which I assume is this hotel's target demo.  No one was too crazy while we were there, and they were all pretty respectful of the other guests - this was not a spring break type crowd.  Oddly, there was a large amount of noise from the parties in the pools areas that sort of carried straight upward (to the 53rd floor), but this is to be expected in Vegas on the strip so not a big deal.

Overall:  Very happy with the hotel and accommodations.  Would be five stars if I could wish away that check-in.",1,0,0

I have gone to Aveda twice in the past 8 months since residing in Montreal. Their hair cuts are pretty cheap if you get the academy student to cut it for you. It comes to about $20 and they wash and condition your hair with Aveda products. Students take a bit longer to cut your hair since they have to wait for their instructors' permission to perform each step prior and after the haircut. A typical haircut is around 2 hours. but it's definitely worth it! When you get to the salon, you check in (it is better to call and make an appointment than showing up there since they don't have many availabilities last minute) and there is self serve tea and coffee. Your hairdresser comes down and brings you to their station. They ask you if you would like anything to drink and then begin asking you what you would want to get done today. After deciding, they massage your scalp with Aveda branded essential hair oil and then give you a back and shoulder massage. Once the massage is done, they wash and condition your hair. Finally. they cut and blow-dry your hair. I have received many compliments after getting my hair done there and my hair feels and smells great after my haircut.

You're eating at a chain restaurant made to look like a cottage.  If that's true, why are the servers dressed all in black with short skirts?  They should be wearin' plaid or something.

Now onto the review...

It's OK.  Just like how the décor isn't related to the uniform, the food doesn't really scream COTTAGE.  In fact, I'm sure a good majority of it is similar to Jack Astor's, Shoeless Joe's, Milestones, etc.  Menu-wise, it's pretty standard, nothing stands out.  There's burgers, wings, fajitas, blah, blah, blah.

I ordered Basa Fish Tacos ($12.99).  Wished that it was a better kind of fish, but it was the cheapest and blackened as opposed to battered.  There was too much stuff going on top:  lettuce, guac, pineapple salsa, and some sauce.  It came with a HUGE side of your choice (soup\/salad\/fries, etc.), but they weren't listed on the menu.

My meal was ok.  I was full after the 2 tacos, didn't touch my salad.  Apparently the Blackened Basa was really good with garlic mashed potatoes underneath.  Calamari was just standard.  Fish 'n Chips looked a bit greasy, especially fries since they were underneath the piece of fish.

Nothing super memorable and nothing I'd go back running to.",1,1,0

When I got there the lines was ridiculously long.  They said the wait was over 3 hours long.  I don't know if it's just me but I would never wait in line for 3 hours to eat anywhere.  Luckily my husband is a VIP card holder so we didn't have to wait in the long line which was definitely a plus.  Otherwise I would have left without trying this place.

I have tried mostly all the buffets in Vegas so I had really high expectations for this place. For a buffet their decor is very impressive.  Maybe that's why their prices are a bit higher than most other buffets in Vegas.  

The food was pretty good and the dessert selection was great but I don't see anything that really stands out about this place except for the fact that you have to stand in line for hours for most people and that the price is more than most of the other buffets where you can get about the same quality of food for less in my opinion.

Samosa was okay. Filled with potatoes & a couple of veggies very little spice or sauce for those that edge on the side of caution with Indian food.  Pretty bland by itself - there was sauce on the plate that one could try.

Lamb kebabs - little spicier, flavorful like what you might get at a Greek restaurant.  Very little to distinguish itself here.  Dipped in the raitka added a bit of flavor.

Chicken masala - my friend was not impressed & felt that Indian buffets he has been to in the past were just as good.

The parking, particularly at specific times of the week can be very annoying. There's simply not enough of it.

Driving around is a pain as well as the design of the streets forces you to swerve everywhere with no direct straight access points that make you randomly find yourself staring at the end of the parking lot because they decided to break the street off, forcing you to make several detours to get around it to end up where you wanted to be.

The restaurant is BYOB so if you want something to drink make sure you bring a bottle of wine or beer. My husband and I ordered the  large flank steak, the small lamb chops and a side of mushrooms to share.  The flank steak was mediocre. I prefer my husbands over theirs. The flank steak could have been more flavorful.  The side salad and the mushrooms were good but there was nothing outstanding about the sides.  The side salad and mushrooms tasted like any other restaurant.  My husband liked the lamb chops. But said they were average tasting.  The portion size is small. My husband could have easily ate all of the food himself. I was hoping for a really different tasting, flavorful meal but everything we had was average tasting. With that said I would be willing to go back and maybe try one of the sandwiches on the menu.  I think we just maybe did not order the right thing. But the atmosphere is fun and hip and the BYOB would be a good addition if you had to wait in a really long line. #3stars",0,0,0

I happened to be in the area and wanted to try it out. The outside looks great there is murals painted all over the building. When we walked in the place the first thing we noticed was that is was a small little cute place. It doesn't feel too inviting and there isn't much decor. 

1st off we arrive and we weren't greeted until a few minutes later. Once we were sat we wait at least 10\/15 mins until we are greeted by our server granted it was a busy day. Only half of our table actually received the drinks they ordered and our server took forever to bring us our drinks\/apps\/ food! The service was sooooo slow not as friendly as I would have expected it to be given that it's been featured on national television and for the over priced food this place has I expected wayyyy better service for the staff! 


Okay well now on to the food!!!

For apps we ordered: 
-Guacamole: it wasn't the greatest the pomegranate seeds did add a good kick to it but the guacamole overall had no flavor it was missing lime, salt, & pepper and just flavor in general. 

-Equites: (Roasted yellow corn with garnishing) this was good it came with spicy mayo cheese and lime. 

Entrees: 
-Fish tacos: Were really good the fish was fried and had great flavor but nothing out of this world. 

-Chilaquiles: they came in a green sauce with an over easy egg on top. I've had way better Chilaquiles else where. These weren't crunchy they were a bit mushy which I didn't like at all and you could somewhat taste the oil in them. 

-Chiles en Nogada: my sister ordered this because everyone raved about how great it was, the plate failed to impress us! It wasn't as amazing as everyone said it was. It was all sweet but no savory in it...what ruined the meal for my sister is that as she was eating it she found a produce sticker still on her chile!!! It was such a disappointment and made us all think twice on how unsanitary and careless this place maybe. Given that's they can't even take the time to wash their produce correctly!  

- Enchiladas Suzias de pollo: my brother order this and he said they were alright not really worth $20. There was nothing special about them that you can't get at any other place. 

-Cochinita Pibil: we all agreed that this was the best meal of all. The meat was pork, the portion of the meat was big and had great flavor. Overall was a very satisfying plate. It did come with side dishes mash and veggies. 

As for all the other dishes they weren't anything amazing! This place is just over priced because it's been featured on TV and it falls short of service and flavor! I wouldn't go out of my way to try this place again. There are other places that are 10Xs better for half the price and better service!",6,0,0

The food itself was good, and the discount made it even better. 

FOOD
The pizza is the highlight, available in thin crust and Chicago deep dish style, which is similar to Pizza Hut's pan pizza rather than Giordano's. Crispy, thick, buttery crust was great. The 9"" medium is enough for two to share if you add on an app.  They offer several (9?) signature pies, the Parmigiana is their take on Eggplant Parm with sliced roasted eggplant and tomato. Great choice. 
Wings are nicely meaty, app portion is ample for the price (9 wings for $8). No flavors available to specify for sauce, bleu cheese or ranch dip available prepackaged.
Salads are available in half and full sizes, few different varieties, fresh produce in a decent sized portion. Prepackaged dressings. 

SERVICE
The staff are friendly, the online ordering system is easy to use, and my pickup order was ready within 5 minutes of the scheduled time. There is counter service only, majority of business seems to be takeout and delivery. The guys were nice, but out of three items ordered only one was received correctly.

I don't usually let advertising sway me, but I wanted a quick lunch and I wasn't particularly concerned about healthy. I mean, you'd have to be an idiot to think that fried chicken is anything other than grease that cooks out any of the goodness of a chicken breast.

This Bojangles (I like to pronounce it ""Bo-hang-gless"") is around the corner from my office and sort of on the way home, so I opted to pop in and sit down so that I could carefully consider the meal in its proper environment. It was what it was. A very large chicken breast with a fluffy biscuit and decent sized servings of ""dirty rice"" and mac-and-cheese. The chicken was a little greasy but I did find a good amount of meat under the battering. The rice wasn't that special. The mac-and-cheese, on the other hand, was really good. Sharp cheesy flavor, I also hit it with some of their spicy Cajun sauce for a little kick.

The restaurant itself is in a food-court style eatery with some other places in here if you're with others and looking to get meals from different establishments. Free wi-fi worked well and the TV's provided a useful distraction.

Points for it being open at lunch when other Ethiopian restaurants in the neighbourhood are not (and there are literally more than a dozen on this stretch of the Danforth). 

The first time, I ordered a veg sampler for 2 to go. It was packaged well, arrived in a timely fashion, and I got to sit at the cute if exposed-feeling bar and have a wine. But when I got to my friend's place, the salad was missing. The green salad just wasn't there--what the what?! That's literally one of my favourite parts about a vegetarian platter--getting to pinch the different lentil and veg stews with injera along with some chopped salad tossed in that signature lemony savoury dressing. It's critical to the whole flavour, texture, hot\/cold contrast experience. And so, a big disappoint--I felt bad for bringing lacking take-out to my Ethiopian-food loving friend. 

The next time, me and my family ate here for dinner. My boys are versed in Ethiopian food having sampled it many places. Service: good but not sparkling--I was amused that the servers wear tops that look like bowling shirts. Ambience: fine but nothing special. I appreciated the presence of locals, murals, wood paneling, and booths. The vegetarian sampler was lacking in deep flavours, as before.

I had dinner there on 4\/8\/2016.  Made reservations via Open Table but there were plenty of free tables at 745 when we arrived.   Dropped my friend at the door and drove the car around a very long block to finally decide on a non legal spot close to the intersection but still not blocking anyone or the crosswalk.  With such limited parking its odd the way Lakewood has chosen to set the distances for cars from intersections it looks like they lose 2 cars on each street so they lose like 8 cars all around sometimes.  But so be it. Our table was just next to the car, but inside.  I was able to watch the car and when the police did in fact show (no real crime in Lakewood?) I walked out and moved it to another spot after circling the block again.  Alas it was a different non legal spot this time just around the corner and again in my field of view. So there is something to be said for the big windows they have in this regard.  If we weren't so close to being done on my second trip around the block I would have chosen a legal spot about 1\/4 mile down the adjacent street. 

We had Porchetta, Porchetta (Duck, pork belly, bacon porchetta, Nuoc Mau, sesame cashew brittle) ; Edamame; Tofu Pad Thai (Cleveland tofu, rice noodle, ginger sriracha, cashew, edamame, carrot, cilantro, sweet soy)(with shrimp added). These meals were really great.   Prepared very well and served nicely.  Excellent flavors.  The fried Cleveland Tofu in the Pad Thai was fantastic.  They had cloth napkins. And reusable chopsticks which I found unusual for a Japanese restaurant.  They plating was unusual in form, white, and very lovely. The waiter was superbly informed and funny.  They had a nice wine and drink list but we had no alcohol to drink.  There are lots of cool and interesting things on the menu so there is a lot more i want to try. 

The food and service was a five,  the interior was nice I would say a four,  I like that they project very interesting photos on the walls in place of fixed art.  They are very bight and interesting.  The location with lack of parking is a two but its not a bad location don't get me wrong, its safe, well lit, on Madison and close to tons of other things.

They have a lot of machines and a nice selection of free weights, but they don't maintain any of it.  Once a machine breaks down they don't fix it...they just remove it from the club.

And the place is just filthy!  All of the floor covering in the Men's locker room is cracked and peeling, and the bathrooms are a disaster.  

This is classified as a Super Sport Club, so they are supposed to furnish towels.  Many times in the past when there were no towels available the front desk crew would claim that they were still in the washer or dryer.  But for the last few weeks they have posted signs that their dryer is broken, and they are suspending towel service until further notice.  Nothing like working out on a machine still wet from someone else's sweat.  

And the air conditioning has been mostly ineffective or broken ever since the beginning of the summer.  

Nothing like trying to work out in a filthy, hot gym with no towels.

I ordered a classic margarita ($8) and a steak ($22), and they both left quite a bit to be desired. The drink was weak. For $8 dollars, I'd expect what feels like a full serving of tequila. 

The steak was equally disappointing. Expecting a full cut of meat, I was served three or four lukewarm slices of steak with a drizzle of sauce, some cold mashed potatoes, and an assortment of vegetables that didn't add much to the meal. I left hungry and disappointed. 

The one advantage of such disappointing portion sizes is that the weak margarita actually accomplished the same as a stiff one would.

Quality and quantity aside, I need to address the lack of value here. I've had better, cheaper Mexican food and drink in Manhattan. This is North Carolina. The Taco truck at the gas station in Huntersville serves what seems like better food in larger portions for a third of my entree's cost. 

Mestizo has a ton of potential and is in a great location, but they need to deliver on the food and drink, their bread and butter, before I'll follow the other reviewers and comment on the quality of the interior decoration.",1,1,0

However, I have two major complaints: 1, An estimated wait time of 45min on a Friday night at a restaurant that doesn't accept reservations isn't a big deal. What is annoying is when that 45 min turns into almost 1.5h as it did for our party. I understand that the restaurant can't control some variables (like how long diners will remain at their tables) but they given the obvious success of the establishment they should either accept reservations or expand. 2. The frites were absolutely disgusting. I've had frites before (in France admittedly, not Belgium), and I don't think they should should be entirely comprised of the burnt, crunchy ends of the fry as ours were. They looked and tasted like the greasy mess that's likely present in deep fryers at the end of a shift. Given the classic combination of moules with frites there's no excuse for messing this up.

It was the first good Mexican food I had in a while.  This experience, however... NOT GOOD! I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE. 
First off, there was dried food in my water glass.  My co-worker who sat next to me had something stuck to his fork, so he exchanged it out for different silverware and the new set had cheese still attached to the knife. I was repulsed.
We got our food and I ordered chimichangas.  They were gross!  The ground beef on the inside was tasteless, not even salt or pepper... nothing.  When I cut it open water, grease, or some liquid poured out.  I can't believe that someone would serve that quality of food and charge the prices they were charging.

It took over 10 minutes for our server just to stop by our table. It was pretty dead in the restaurant, so it wasn't as if our server was slammed. Then, when I asked our server a simple question regarding one of the dishes, it took her another 10 minutes to come back with the answer. 

When they delivered the meal, they had forgotten to bring the side of garlic toast that we had ordered. When we told the runner, he noted our missing item and left back into the kitchen. We figured he had gone back in to get the toast. 

Then, after another 10 minutes passed, our server came out to inform us that they were out of garlic toast. That it would be ANOTHER ten minutes for the toast to cook. We said forget it! At that point we would have been done with the meal.  But, there was never an apology or ""can i bring you anything else.""

The decor is lovely, modern, and great background music conducive for dates.  My two colleagues and I were quite hungry, and the waiter promptly served bread and drinks.  The menu has great choices....I decided to take a chance on the jumbo lump crab and avocado salad appetizer.  We also ordered truffle pizza with arugula salad.

The crab appetizer was served in a cylindrical design with a tomato broth.  This dish did not work for me.  First of all, no crab lumps...just stringy crab.  Clearly not fresh.  The avocado was quite bland, and the cilantro was too strong for the dish.  The tomato broth was intolerable.  It was a complicated dish that was not executed well.

The truffle pizza was pleasant and earthy; however, the arugula was too strong for the subtle flavor of the pizza.  All in all, it was just OK without the arugula.

For the entree, I ordered a baked black cod dish with mushrooms, beef fritters, wine emulsion, and creamed leeks.  I felt the $32 price was a bit steep for the serving size; however, it looked delicious.  I took a forkful with everything on it to get the full flavor...and the verdict is salty with a hint of dull.  The cod looked great, but as I bit into it, the texture was off...a bit undercooked.  The textures and flavors didn't work for me...the food was not fresh...but the one consistent theme was salt.  My co-worker only finished half of her bacon wrapped chicken dish.

All in all, don't go for dinner.  However, for breakfast, the buffet is a great choice at $28.  That's why I did not give it a 1-star.",2,0,1

Sure, other factors do play a small role: such as how much it costs, how quickly it gets done, how close it is to where you are and how friendly the staff is. To be fair, the cost is a personal issue: for some $35 to wash your car is a ridiculous waste, while others may consider it a fair price. 

Of course, no matter whether you decide a fair price for a car wash is $35 or $3.50, you know what to expect. And if you decide to spend $35 - well, you expect it to be clean.

So no matter what you think is a fair price for a car wash, I can assure you that Washworks is not the place you want to go.

The pico de gallo, or ""tomatoes"", is god awful now, seems like they completely removed the red onion from the salsa and it is in fact just ""tomatoes"" now. Also, avoid doing more than one order at once because the predictive genies will throw something in your order when you aren't looking, or fail to hear what you asked them to add in and have the lid on and your order rang up before you can notice.",0,1,0

We had to wait 15 minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant was 3\/4 empty.  Then, after ordering, I was presented with a Baby Spinach Salad without any dressing on it at all.  The Buttermilk Biscuit Croutons were very good, but the dish just did not come together as a whole.

The fairly large shrimp in a Shrimp Cocktail were meaty and cold, but not that tasty.  And the Horsey Sauce accompanying this app was just too mild.  When my entrée at length arrived, its diminutive appearance was quite underwhelming: two small fillets of Pan Seared Trout with Cilantro Rice, cut carrots, and Sweet & Sour Cabbage that was not juicy and neither particularly sweet nor sour.  The trout tasted better than it looked, but it was just average in quality.  

Service was very inattentive, and there was a long break between preliminaries and delivery of the entrees.  Seating was comfortable, but the whole vibe was more that of a coffee shop than a casino's featured restaurant.  It would be pretentious to call what was served to my party of four ""fine dining.""

I will start with the room quality, it was fine. Despite an odd hair here and there as well as a few handprints, the room was clean enough. Decorations were nice.
Now onto everything else. Boiled down, the whole experience lacked customer service. We had the feeling of being cattle to be herded around. Drop off is confusing, we had no idea where we were meant to go with our car and luggage (unless we wanted valet.) Parking costs money even if you are staying there (in fact, all MGM properties are charging for parking now.) When I went to check in while my boyfriend circled for instructions, I noticed two line. One of the line was impossibly long and one area had something called mobile check in, which seemed quicker. I booked with hotels.com and so needed help from the one attendant in that area, he tried his best but was all alone while people kept barging in and taking over. He then sent me to another line and said (before being abducted by another guest) that I would get an email, but to go ahead to get in line. I quickly got through the
 line without receiving the email and asked the lady if it was important, she said yes and I can't check in until I get it....even though check in is it 3 and it was about 3:15pm. I asked how long it should be before I get the email and got a shrug of the shoulders and a half hearted ""I dunno."" I explained that my boyfriend was waiting for me to tell him what to do, they said we could park. Their whole interaction with me was lethargic and could care less. So they sent me away to wait on the email. I waited 45 minutes. Now, I worried that I put in email wrong and wasn't sure how long I should wait before asking for help. I went back to the mobile check in kiosk, where a new lady took over for the young man. After I explained my worry, how I had no time estimate, and how I have been waiting 45 minutes for an email (an hour after check in time.) She explained that it should only take 20 minutes and that the emails are processed by people. She felt bad and gave me a paper with my info that she found on her tablet and sent me back in line where I got the same person as before and the same cold reception. At least I finally was processed.
To get our luggage my boyfriend, again, got the car and was going to meet me in the back  while I look for a luggage cart. None were to be found and there was no one to help, I did eventually find a small, dirty phone for the bell desk where I was told  it was a 15-20 minute wait before they could send someone, but I cancelled it because I was hoping to be in our room by then (my own impatience won out.) So we juggled our luggage up to the 10 floor. Our door lock and key was ridiculously outdated and unresponsive. Then we realized we had the wrong room, we had requested a king (my boyfriend is 6'7"" and neither of us are small.)  Our room had two queens, I called down to the desk and they explained that we had 'run of the house' (I had no idea what that meant.) Although I booked a king, they are allowed to give me whatever, I asked to be moved and they told me they had no kings to give. So me and my boyfriend slept our one night in Las Vegas separately.

Now, let me tell you what is fantastic about this, and why I would come back here in a heart beat.

The rooms are small - but this in Montreal.  If you're doing anything in your room other than sleeping then you're doing it wrong.  Breakfast is free.  It feels like a hostel when you're in the breakfast room - international experience as people all fill their faces, sneak some food into their bags, and head out for the day.

It's right beside China Town (which is a great place to be.)  It's walking to the subway, it's walking to the bus.  It's walking to the city, it's walking to the water.  It's perfectly located.

You can easily walk from the Train Station to this hotel without hating yourself.

Aside from the small rooms - there's no reason not to stay here.

Mind you, if you like a big room, and a TV that works - this place is not for you.  Just keep that in mind.

Thanks yelp for pointing me in the direction of Mediocre Maizie's (which seems to be the consensus around here). Well, Khamis H. and I thought we had scored big time and found a New Favorite. Before we had even received our food! A brash statement, but maybe it was the chalkboard sign greeting us at the door with $3 mimosas and the brunch until 4pm (on Sundays). We were really hungry and Maizie filled us up!

I woke up that particular Sunday wanting a delicious breakfast burrito. And I got one at Maizie's. I will admit it needed a little something something on the inside but it probably would have been great with the ham that I vegetarian-ly omitted. Khamis H. got a build-your-own ""omelet"" aka scramble that came with potatoes and toast. Looked good. 

A lot on the menu sounded awesome too like the sandwiches and pizza but I am most intrigued by the 3-6 happy hour and discounted apps. Blue Moon on draft people! 

I did enjoy the interior, it was almost that trendy-familiar aesthetic but different enough to be unique. The sunny patio reminded me of a joint in San Diego. And I was amazed by the totally see-through sink in the bathroom.

One con: Apparently you can get a burger and fries on Mondays for $3, but this excludes the house-made veggie burger. Sadness. At least Maizie said, regretfully, that she wished she could, but can't. hmf.",1,1,2

Not only have they repeatedly left my equipment in worse condition than before they arrived, a recent visit had the technician removing my temperature measuring device from my home twice. I caught him the first time, he returned later that day disgruntled to undo the work he did at my request, and he repeated the removal of the same device. I mentioned it to the company's representative the next day and he told me they would return it. Now in a Better Business Bureau claim they have denied that theft and wondered why I didn't call the police. Why would I call the police if a contractor accidentally left with my device and I assumed it would be returned (I used the same device he used), I assumed it was an accident, but the refusal to return the property now indicates theft. I strongly urge anyone reading this to find another contractor, this one is highly unethical. If you do choose to use this company, I would record via video every moment of their presence on your property, not necessarily for theft, but for anything in which you end up needing to discuss with them at a later date, because I assure you they will deny everything that is negative in their favor. The true sign of a company with no oversight of the day to day operations by it's owners. It's clear to me the problems are hidden from them. They need to look into their managerial structure.
As far as ability to install and support HVAC systems, they have repeatedly proven they can't, the install had to be done twice and just about everything they have ever attempted on the unit has had to be undone.
I will not cease pursuit of resolution no matter how many days, weeks or years it takes.
Anyone thinking of using this attempt at a legitimate company can contact me directly at 602-527-3000 to discuss the infractions over the years I've incurred from them in more detail.

I attempted to speak to their GM of Warranty Services today, but he didn't seem to be interested, his response to the BBB claim about their inability to diagnose a poorly running unit contained nothing but denials and long tangents about things having nothing to do with the issues.  My only recourse is to seek out and contact the owners as I know they are not aware of what has happened.  That is, even if the operators of the company were to notify them, it would not be an accurate representation of the facts.  But I have a solid feeling issues are generally hidden from the true stakeholders of the company.",1,0,0

I went with a roommate and we shared three dishes: twice cooked pork ($13), ma po tofu ($11), and chicken with Sichuan sauce($9).  We both got orders of steamed rice, which cost an extra dollar per portion.

The twice cooked pork had some sort of bacon-type meat which was enjoyable with the green onion and while hot but less so as it became cooler.  The tofu was excellent a generous spicy sauce that probably included numbing pepper.  And the chicken was tender and the vegetables cooked just right.  The rice was fresh.

I definitely recommend Fugu if you're looking for spicy, well sauced Chinese\/Szechuan dishes.  All the dishes were made to order and came out hot and delicious, though more expensive than your typically-priced Chinese dishes.  The service is also quite nice.

The food is fantastic - like, really good - the location is great, the ambiance is nice, and the servers (at least the female server I had) are pleasant and efficient. But I came during Winterlicious and they added a compulsory %15 tip (AFTER tax) to my bill. Excuse me? Since when does a restaurant dictate to me what I tip? Let alone forcing me to tip OVER the standard, which is 15% on the PRE-TAX amount. I asked the male server about it and he said it's something they do during Winterlicious because ""We have problems."" This does not satisfy me as an excuse for what is basically a dictatorial, money-grubbing practice. If I want to tip, I'll tip. If not, you have no right to force me. When I asked why they had calculated the tip on the post, not pre-tax amount, he looked uncomfortable and couldn't provide any answer.

Sadly, this left such a terrible taste in my mouth after what was otherwise a pleasant experience that I probably won't go back. Too bad.

UPDATE in response to Samira M's comments below--

1) Yes, it's true that the compulsory gratuity was noted on the menu. Doesn't make it right though!

2) I will most likely be back because, as I noted, the food and service were very good. Especially the food. Yum.

3) Please note, Samira, that there is no such thing as a ""minimum gratuity"" when dining unless the restaurant chooses to impose one. Tipping is, and always has been, OPTIONAL. There is no law that says a customer has to tip.

4) Similarly, the suggestion that 15% ""was the standard 25 years ago"" simply makes no sense. Yes, it was the standard 25 years ago, and it still is today. Are you suggesting that the rate of tipping should increase with the rate of inflation, increasing by 2% every year? By that logic, the average tip in 2012 should be 55% of the bill. In another 25 years, the ""standard tip"" would be 100% of the bill. Huh? The standard tip is the standard tip and this does not change, which everyone except Toronto's restaurant owners seems to understand.",10,7,2

I originally thought that it would have a much bigger produce section, but the ready to go meal section made up for it.

Tried the rotisserie chicken, on the box it show it's a Cajun flavored chicken, but I don't really sense any heat from it.
may be it's been sitting under the heating elements for a bit too long (didn't picked it up until 8:30pm when it said on the box is done at 4pm).
overall the chicken is a bit dry and not much flavor.
will try again when it's fresh off the oven and may be another flavor.

also tried some of the food from the self-serve hot table, it's priced the same as salad or grains, $2.29 for 100g.
I'm so not used to this type of pricing, as I really have no idea how 100g looks like. 
(but then again, how else should they price it?)
I choose some lentils, some potato cooked in a curry spices, and some chili corn carne.
each are about 2 ladles, and it comes out to be $16+, much much more expensive than I would have for chili or lentils.
they really got to have a different container for things that have a bit more sauce, as I bring it home, the container are totally soaked and the chili gets dried-up.

I guess I will try something else next time.

Max occupancy is only 70 so you can quickly get into a 45 min wait time. The wait area is not separate from the eating area so unfortunately while we were trying to eat, people who were waiting and didn't have clear restaurant manner would stand with their backs practically right against our table talking loudly, even though in the wait area there was plenty of room for them to stand. I was disappointed that the 3 hostesses didn't ask people to move into the wait area away from the people dining. I almost asked the people myself to move away from our table. Having said that the staff was some of the friendliest I have ever encountered, very funny and interested in us and what had brought us out to them.

Onto the food! All in all it was mixed for me. We tried the loaded fries but for me they were lacking in flavor and were nothing very special. They weren't bad, just not something I would pay for again. One of my favorite things is Ahi tuna so I went for the seared ahi tuna burger. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. With the description of the burger with the cole slaw and the glaze I was expecting it to burst with flavor. Instead there was literally no flavor at all...zero. $14.50 and I only ate half of it. The tuna was also so tough that I couldn't bite through it and almost choked and got sick at the table because I couldn't get it down.
My daughter's burger is a different story. This was probably one of the best burgers I have ever had. She got the blanco burger, Pico, guac and pepper jack cheese with the Kobe beef and it was outstanding. It definitely had that punch of flavor I had been hoping for in my burger. My only negative was they use the sweet Hawaiian buns for their burgers and that just doesn't work in my opinion. The sweetness is too much and makes it taste like you have sugar sprinkled on your burger.  It wouldn't stop me from eating here again, I would just not order the tuna again and go for one of the more flavorful selections. The iced tea was excellent as well! Fresh brewed black or green tea was magnificent. You could tell it was super fresh and very crisp tasting.
All in all I would recommend this place, we will go back. The next time I will know what to avoid and will hopefully enjoy it more!",3,0,0

You enter into a restaurant and you say wow this is a really nice restaurant (caution don't be fooled). We were seated glasses on the table were mostly clean but one had a dried lipstick stain on it.

Now for the food, very tasteless and blend, seemed dishes were cooked long time ago so were not fresh nothing looked fresh with the exception of fried stuff and Chinese rice.

They had problem keeping the serving plates stocked, they kept on running out of food and people had to make several trips to get a one serving (This is the same problem we encountered when we went last time). When i complained i was told that everyone is going at the same time and people should be behave and give some time let others get what they want let us fill up and then others should go (this is what i got out of their logic and told them that this is a buffet and they should be prepared for this situation)

Take him (or her) to Corsa for an overpriced meal that will, literally, *leave* him (or her) in pain.  The only excuse for the Vegas-high price of food here is the need to cover the cost of all the salt they must use in preparing the food.

My first bite of fried calamari was like emptying a salt shaker in my mouth.  Bravely, I continued on with the mushroom-salt paste pizzetta and a so-so dish of rich mashed potatoes.  Veal parmigiana was as good as Buca di Beppo's, which is not saying much IMHO, and the short rib rigatoni was heavy on the fat (oh, and did I mention the ragu was salty?).

Had a friend who is suffering from Cancer, wanting to celebrate his birthday.  At the last minute, he changed his mind from wanting ""fish"" to ""steak"", I said, ""I KNOW THE PERFECT PLACE!""  Having never dined at the Summerlin location, I decided this would be the perfect chance... 
Boy was I wrong.
Sunday Night - 7 :15 PM - The place has no more than 9 tables of customers (NOT ""busy"") - We get seated and our waitress had ""attitude"".  She acted as if the LAST place she wanted to be, was in that building, let alone working...  
Our table was missing the ""tongs"" used to take the meat.  I mentioned this to her.  She rolled her eyes and said, ""yeah, I'll get you some.""
And didn't.
We had our salad bar (which was missing the soup, when I asked, the girl stocking the salad bar said, ""We ran out""  I thought to myself, ""Sunday night, 7 PM - and they RAN OUT OF SOUP?"" ) Ok - we move forward...  The fact that the salad bar is not NEARLY as impressive as the Flamingo Location - it still had a nice selection...
Finished Salads, no sides delivered yet?  We did get bread (same girl with attitude), I mention, ""Could we get our tongs?""  She gave me a ""look"" and said, ""I said I will get them for you!"" (that was 20 minutes prior...)  I smiled and said, ""OK, thank you.""  We finish our salads and flip our coasters to Green.  Here comes the first selection of meat.   The guy carving cuts down a slice and says, ""You must grab it with your tongs"" - I told him we had asked for tongs twice and didn't get any - HE rolled his eyes and said, ""I'll get you some"" - he goes and tells someone else - they grab tongs in a hurry -and suddenly, HERE COMES MS ATTITUDE with MORE tongs!  We now have four sets of tongs!  The meat service was ""meh"" - All but one meat server seemed to NOT want to be their also?!?  (I have a feeling they have management issues?!?)  Desert time!  My friend wants the Vanilla Ice Cream and they inform us ""sorry, we ran out - you can not order ANYTHING with vanilla ice cream - oh - and we ran out of the chocolate molten cake, too""

It is delicious and has a subtle gingseng taste.  My spouse has had the bibimbap and tofu soup, both of which were great.

And what's with the bottles of water they bring to the table?  There's a reason why every other buffet gives patrons those huge tumblers of water.

It was the ones you used to buy in the machines where you put in a quarter and turn the knob. (retail price $2.50).

They were treated completely different from how we were. 

Discrimination and racial prejudice is something I have felt and dealt with before, and I stand up against it, so I asked him.

I got in free, because I am a local female.  Other than that nicety, my visit to studio 54 was a complete waste of time.

The crowd disappointed me on every front.  On all sides of me girls danced bowlegged in ill-fitting ""fuck me"" heels.   They were seized upon by rumpled, dog-faced men, who swept their selected partner into the seething dance floor.  For all the inter-gender friction and froth, there wasn't a talented dancer among the bunch.  Just sad, spastic dry humping.  

Ages ranged from 21-35.  I saw some totally wasted white single females wandering around like newborn foals, so if that's what tickles your pickle, have at it.  

The drink I ordered was strong, and reasonably priced by Vegas standards.  I have to hand it to the bartenders.  They move like well oiled machines.

Although the venue itself was pretty, and looked like it had the potential for fun, I couldn't get into the place.  Think a dressed-up warehouse feel:  exposed pipes, steel grating, neon, a giant disco ball, and video screens.  As for the extensive lighting system, the DJ seemed clueless.  He only used it to about 1\/4 of its ability.    

Their female go-go dancers need to switch to light beer, or something.  I'm all about girls with curves, but no one likes cheese.  Protip:  if your gut stops dancing 4 seconds after the rest of your body, you probably shouldn't be spending your evenings scantly clad, gyrating on a podium.  I understand that these bouncing muffin-top girls were probably Studio 54's go go B-squad.  It was a Tuesday night, after all.  But still.  Ladies.  PLEASE.

The one male go go was perfectly chiseled and entirely forgettable.

I might have stuck around if it weren't for the music.  

I loathe rap.  I hate hip hop.  I detest R and B.  And that is all the DJ played while I was there.  Ick.  I'm cool with small doses of that kind of music.  Hell, as long as every other song is rock or electronic, I'm game.  

When are DJ's going to get the message that not everyone wants to booty-bounce all night?  I know I must sound old saying that, but I'm not.  I'm a smokin'-hot 23 year old female.  I'm the demographic they should be trying to attract.

On the way out to have a smoke I noticed the lobster tank ( don't know why I did notice this when I came in ) it is a open top tank that you can look in and and see all the lobsters. One thing I found out is if you want a candle for your butter you have to ask or they will bring it in a little cup ( if your a seafood fan you want the piping hot butter ) My meal comes my crab is cut into small pieces witch I am not a fan of  Prefer the whole legs (personal preference) they were cooked perfect. The lobster tail came with a bread crumb topping on it and was slightly over cooked but still good. The service was a little slow but still ok. All in all I would return to the lobster trap.,0,0,0

As to the ambience: I love the decor it's a chic fusion of modern and vintage, with good lighting balance and unobtrusive and appropriately current music. It looks more like a cute big-city place you'd see in LA, NY or SF. Unlike a review I read, I disagree that it is pretentious, but I guess one could say it is ""hip.""

Service: Super warm and casual. If you like staff to treat you like a regular or friend, this is your spot. Mingo, the proprietor and namesake, stopped by our table and was super friendly and obviously cared that the diner's experience is great. If you are a stickler for formality, you could find it a bit laid-back. Personally, I love candid staff who give honest suggestions and act "" real"":-) 
Food: It's not a huge menu, (I was there for lunch) but every choice is tempting. I think they manage fusion without overreaching. Everything was delicious (and  for any fitness types or non-meat eaters, the menu has more healthy and non-meat options than you would expect.) I think the prices were reasonable and portions a healthy size.
 I'm saving my favorite part for last....Mingo is dog friendly! You can bring your dog(s) to chill at your table on the front patio. There is a clever design detail of an industrial metal door that opens up the bar and restaurant to the patio.

So when I found this one on State Street, I was always excited to try it, because I had this picture in my mind that it was the In N Out of the Midwest - clean and quirky and simple and possessing fries covered in special sauce.

I finally got in here the other day, after convincing myself the calories would finally be worth it, and it probably wasn't as unhealthy as I was making it out to be. (Also, the main display picture on Yelp was less than flattering - another reason I put it off.) And boy was I wrong.

Pretty sure I consumed 408 grams of saturated fat for one of the most mediocre burgers ever. Also, the cashier made ""Five Guys Style"" fries out to be such a big thing. All I really got out of it was that that meant you get 5 (or more?) potatoes worth of fries. Holy crap, I've never eaten that many fries...and I threw some away. The burger was greasy as heck, and I was so scared of the acne attack I'd have afterwards.

Location-wise, the inside left a lot to be desired. It was pretty grimy-feeling, especially the bathroom. And there's not outdoor seating, which I assumed was a staple for and main reason for even owning a business on State. I guess not.

Customer service - UGH.

My friend and I saw this place was opening up months ago and we were very excited to try it. We always happy hour downtown at Vanguard so we figured this would be a perfect place to grab a bite of pizza after drinking. We assumed they'd offer pizza by the slice because pretty much every pizza joint Downtown does.

Upon entering we noted a hostess stand outside, but no hostess, so we walked in. The space is SMALL. As soon as we walked in we were already in the pizza place. There is no area to stand around and not look like a fool if you don't know where you're going. Luckily a hostess (who would turn into our waitress arrived). She asked if it were for two and we said yes, she seated us in their restaurant section which is basically right next to their bar section.   As for decor, it's nicely set up, except for the fact that there is an overload of televisions. And every single one of them was on basketball. My friend and I came to the conclusion that their space over at Tivoli Village must have been bigger and they just weren't willing to give up all those flat screens, so hey, just put 'em everywhere. Seriously guys, lose some of the TVs. Your customers will not miss them.

The night we were there they were offering a limited menu and they were upfront about it, which was nice. At least we didn't go through their full menu and decide on something they did not have. BUT we were disappointed to see the menu offered no option for just ordering by the slice. We got over it and decided to order an 18"" Viva Las Vegas which had pepperoni, a meat I can't remember right now, onions, yellow peppers and white sauce. All of their specialty pizzas sound really good and I would like to go back and try more. Sometimes places do specialty pizzas and you're like WTF? No. But RCP has really good-sounding concoctions.

Our pizza comes out and it looks delicious and smells delicious. We dig right in. First off the crust (for me) was perfect, crunchy, but had that nice chewy texture you get with good NY style pizza. The toppings were salty and sweet and just made this wonderful little pizza-goodness opera in my mouth.

Then comes the downfall of our whole experience.... 

We noted the pizza had not been cut completely. There were slices that actually should have been two slices and not one. I picked one up and it was bigger than my face, so naturally, we just asked if we could have the pizza cut. Our waitress then laid a lovely little explanation\/insult on us.

""Well, this is not Dominos or Pizza Hut, it's NY style pizza so it's bigger than you're used to.""

EXCUSE ME? My friend and I were aghast as our haughty little waitress took our pizza away to be cut ""Dominos-style"" to our peasant liking (apparently). Instead of just cutting our pizza she insults us. Nice touch.

And you know what? I like Dominos AND Pizza Hut so there. Oh and by the way - if there's one food I know pretty much everything about - it's PIZZA! And I certainly know what a NY style slice of pizza looks like. Okay? Pizza is (langauge) fucking pizza, all right? So just cut my fucking pizza.

Knowing that it is a high-end restaurant, I did have high expectations going in. I would say my experience was good, but I was certainly not blown away. I had the Ginger Smash cocktail and I really liked it, but my friend who also ordered it didn't like it at all because the ginger flavor was so intense. It honestly was, my throat was burning while sipping on this drink, but I didn't mind because I like ginger. However, it completely overpowered everything else in the cocktail. Here are the items that were memorable and my thoughts: Chilean Sea Bass entree was melt in your mouth delicious. Beef Tips in Merlot sauce were very tender. Crispy Duck salad, Shrimp in Curry Sauce, and Hakkanoodles were all decent- good but not spectacular. The Beef Ribs appetizer was way too fatty- I didn't like that at all. Unfortunately for dessert it was our friend's birthday and the waiter said he was bringing something out, but all it was was a small Macaroon and a few tiny pieces of candy or something for decoration- definitely not something we could share, so that was disappointing because I probably would have ordered my own dessert if I knew that was all we were getting. This all came with a pretty high price tag. Again, the meal was good, but none of us were blown away, including the birthday boy who absolutely loves Asian food.

I actually called in my order ahead of time so I didn't have to wait very long. The lady who answered the phone was super friendly and helpful. I arrived early so I had to wait a little while but I didn't mind the wait because I knew my food would be fresh. I ordered lemon pepper with fries. The fries were fresh and very well seasoned. The wings were fresh and hot so i had to wait before I could eat them. The only thing I absolutely did not like was there was a think layer of grease in the bottom of the container. That kinda grossed me out because it means they didn't properly drain the food before placing in the to-go container. Now mind you, the wings are probably not the best thing to be eating but they should have at least let grease soak off before giving to the customer. I had to wrap the wings in paper towels to get all the grease off. 

I would go back again but I would make sure to give specific instructions to ensure grease was drained properly and order more fries. :-)",10,9,11

The help here seemed eager enough, though not the most competent, causing me to have to repeat myself after each request I made.

Then, upon asking for a flavor that was clearly displayed as available, the worker looked deep down into the freezer case bottom only to find that it had expired.  She then mysteriously disappeared out back and returned back again offering to serve it to myself (and other future customers) even though it was three months past expiration.

Iom6I8SQBtL8om0ynqYe-Q,ddLCP6vItT4L6wclbB4zWw,Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ,1,2012-10-23,"CONTEXT: Recently graduated college dudes stop by Cabo Wabo at the tail end of a weekend, because it has the unbeatable combination of queso and 97 televisions.

THE REVIEW: Jesus Herbert Christ.  We went into this not caring that it had a 2ish star review, and expecting it to be standard sub-par Tex Mex.  What we got were plates of butt vomit, mildly unique from each other, served in convenient thirty minute intervals.

I guess I should mention positive aspects of the experience first.  The hostess was very, very attractive, as were many of the kind, smart, and important ladyfolk on the waitstaff.  We must have been assigned the one legacy bid, but that wasn't much of a big deal (side note - there were about 150 waitresses, all coming from upstairs or the kitchen, at all times.  There were twenty patrons.  Who are you serving?  What the hell is upstairs!?  Irrelevant.  I apologize).  When ordering, the waitress let us know that salsa came with the queso, and it would be a waste of money to order the chips and salsa.  That's groovy, in my book.  She did that once or twice again when we were ordering our meals, and probably saved us about ten dollars by letting us know random things our hangovers weren't allowing us to pick up on by ourselves.  Lastly, there was a TV in every corner, and they were all on the Sunday night NFL game.  No nonsense from ESPN8: The Ocho or garbage political newsfeeds.  Bueno.

The one reason we stopped here, above all others, was cheese dip.  It is a staple of our recovery rubric.  It is a communion cracker of sorts, after a bingy, gambly wreck of a weekend in Las Vegas.  The queso at Cabo Wabo was of decent consistency, with pico de gallo sprinkled on top.  It never filmed, it wasn't powdered-cheese-turn-queso.  It was physically acceptable.  It tasted, however, like government cheese with a hint of dirt or motor oil from the ungloved hand that had handled it prior to putting it into a bowl and melting it.  Did we eat it?  Shit yes.  Should we have?  I don't know, but it still feels like the demon sauce is painted onto my esophagus.  It came with thick chips that probably would have been tasty, had they been heated or lightly salted before arriving.  The salsa is a thick roasted pepper (chipotle?) salsa that was on the edible side of questionable.

I had been craving fajitas all weekend, mostly because my phone auto-corrected a slur I had written in a text to the word ""fajitas"" on the night of our arrival.  Karma for my ignorant textual intention greeted me fist-to-face when I received my hamburger steak fajitas, which arrived with a fajita sizzlesmell that literally caused people at the table to cough.  If your lungs bark at the smell of a food, you're probably experiencing the triggering of some sort of evolutionary warning system.  I ignored it.  My meatloaf fajita was served very well done, over a bed of 90% onions and 10% red peppers.  The fajita complements were all satisfactory, and by the end of the meal, I was making soft tacos with just the guac, sour cream, refried beans, and shredded cheese.

My friends ordered the jalapeno chicken burrito thing, the fish tacos, and the kids' menu chicken fingers.  No one liked their food, save for the manchild who ordered from the kids' menu.  I think the chicken fingers would have been difficult to sabotage, though, given the effort in doing so to the other dishes.  Of note - four chicken strips were twelve dollars.  The fish tacos were particularly no good.  It seemed like someone had forgotten to deep fry them, or had intentionally *shrug* *middle finger to no one in particular* *microwave*'d them.

Our bill came out to about 25 dollars a person.  That may be an inaccurate number, though, because I don't know if it garnered interest while we waited for our waitress to pop out of her coma and acknowledge us.  The booth at which we were seated was a backseat pulled from a 1983 Ford Tempo, and our cups of pond water may have had mosquitoes camping out on them.  I can't recall.  Notwithstanding our miserable experience, the $4.00 plastic cup of Coke I ordered was delicious...

OH!  Afterthought!  We were denied outdoor seating, despite the 8-10 empty tables we noticed on the patio.  It was probably for the best, as the daystar would have ruined us worse than Cabo Wabo did on its own.  I wish I had more hands, so I could give Sammy's place four thumbs down.

Walking up to our double doors we had very high expectations, but all we could find was disfunction and disorder. We had to move out of our first room because our hot tub was shooting out black residue when we turned the jets on. The room service supervisor came up to speak with us and the only reaction we got from her was a cold ""That's not our fault"" demeanor. I also had to point out that a lot of the fixtures needed to be dusted and there were multiple hand prints on our head boards.

Our next room was a lot better, but we still had problems with our tub. The water just wouldn't hold. We kept playing with the knobs to no avail. We were really bummed due to the fact that the tub is what sold us to the room. Everything else went pretty smoothly except the fact that the remote was so difficult to use. Every time a button was pushed it took a couple seconds for the TV to register what was entered. It was also annoying that the remote had to be pointed at exactly the right angle for it to work. 

I must say it is a good deal for the money, but only if everything that was promised was delivered. 

A couple days after we got back from our vacation my boyfriend started to get a rash in his armpit. I also got one on my thigh. The only thing we can think of is that dreaded hot tub. When was the last time that was cleaned?

Would I come back? Only if someone else paid for the room. I wouldn't bother wasting my money on a mediocre hotel. It surely did put a damper on my Birthday trip. Next time I'll spend a couple more dollars on a hotel that pays attention to detail.

The accommodations were alright (400's a suite)-I don't have incredibly high standards, but the furniture in our suite was rather dated and appeared as though it hadn't been updated since 1992.  Everything was clean, and I can tolerate outdated much better than dirty.  While I don't need a flat screen tv, I do appreciate one that does not have diagonal fuzzy lines through the picture, the channel selection was also slim.  The biggest issue for me was the internet connection.  I couldn't stream video because the connection was less than 1MBPS download.  The 'fitness center' was a rather remote location and a bit dismal.  

We did have a hospitality suite on the other side of the resort (700's maybe) and it was actually quite nice, very updated and modern, so perhaps that is part of the varied reviews here-that some of the buildings\/rooms have been renovated and others have not.

The actual conference facility\/meeting rooms were acceptable.  The outdoor space was quite nice and enjoyable.  I had no complaints on the food.  The staff were also decently accommodating.  Though, when I asked about getting transportation into Phoenix, I was met with a blank stare-like no one staying here had ever asked such a thing.

O, and there is a replica of the Ponderosa homestead made by Lorne Greene (Ben Cartwright in the show) on site.  Yeah, that went off the air 10 years before I was born, but the family that runs it is quite nice.  By the end of the event, I had heard a rumor that the facility was in bankruptcy and bank owned which accounted for the lack of updates.

The problem is that it's kind of like a year-long Groupon. Yeah you're getting the services as advertised, but everything is sort of  half assed. The haircutting's pretty good, but the manicure and the shoeshining leaves much to be desired. If you were paying the à la cart price for anyone of the services, chances are you would not return.

Most of the staff are pretty friendly, though not very accommodating should you need to change your appointment. I believe they are understaffed, or staffed only to accommodate existing appointments. Flexibility does not seem to be a priority for them.

The issue really is poor management. While there is a manager, she is not really on the ball. She is visible, but not giving anybody direction when direction is so badly needed.

I'd love to say this is good value for your money, because it so easily could be. But they really don't deliver on my expectations.

Taking a look around the other shoppers was a bit unsettling; I wondered who among these people were buying for less-than-honorable reasons.

Oh, and this business has no website.  No internet presence at all, as far as I could tell.  Really?  In a certain sense, if you aren't willing to at least attempt a website, you don't exist.  So, Pro Gun, you don't exist.

Let me start with the fact that I was surprised that it was pretty cheap, I paid around $6.50 per person (later on I understood why it was so cheap). When we got there it looked that they were understaffed, only 3 guys completely running the restaurant (waiter, cashier and cook). That being said, our dirty plates weren't removed the whole time that we were dining.

To be honest I was surprised to see taco meat and nachos. The taco meat was more like mystery meat, it looked old and dry. The nacho cheese was more like 80% water, 20% cheese.

Maybe I'm just not a fan of cooking my own food. Stab a piece of steak -- dip in pot of hot broth -- wait 3 minutes -- let meat cool a bit -- eat.

Holy moly! Don't come to this place hungry or you will starve. I was sad to see there was nothing on the menu that they could just bring out to you. Since I have an allergy to something in cheese sauce (I know - just shoot me now), I had to start out with the main course.

The dessert was awesome tho. I wished they brought you out all those bakery goodies + a big ol bowl of strawberries to keep going. There was a fair amount of chocolate left on the bottom of our pot by the end of the night. Since going to the Melting Pot, I have purchased their cook book and have made the chocolate recipes at home while setting up my own little ambiance (Melting Pot ambiance is great btw).

Me and seven of my friends and family decided we give give this, relatively new, joint a shot on a Saturday night for dinner and drinks.  Given that they don't take reservations and my party was rather large, I was worried we would have a horrific wait.  Haberdish uses the Nowait app making the wait, well a little less.  Not no wait like the name would suggest.  Regardless, there's many other places to grab a drink while you wait, or no wait, or whatever...

We started off with a few craft cocktails.  Habiscus this, Moscow that.  I can't remember all of the names but everything we tried was really good and mildly flavored.  Nothing has a punch in the face, over bearing flavor of anything.  Well done bar gang!

Shortly after drinks, we had some apps. An assortment of pickles, cheese straws, smoked deviled eggs and hush puppies.  Nothing crazy or out of this world. Everything tastes good but nothing popped.

Entrees came out shortly after we cleared the app plates.  Entrees are healthy portions and sides can be ordered single or family style.  I ordered the pork shank which was very well cooked, very tender.  I wasn't a fan of the house BBQ sauce that was on the pork.  It was almost like a sweet Asian sauce mixed with BBQ.  My table also had some of the chicken and cauliflower steaks.  Chicken was a little dry and tough but the cauliflower steaks were amazing. 

The assortment of sides was plentiful and unique.  Kale grits (grits with creamed kale), sweet potato dumplings, Mac and cheese and corn bread pudding.  They were all good but I was pretty aggravated when we had two corn bread pudding's and one came out completely burnt.  The bottom was jet black.  We weren't charged for it but how that came out to the table was sloppy.

The orders were prepared correctly and we didn't have to wait long. My lunch date thought the presentation could have been better, but it was a casual to-go type eatery so I was fine with the seemingly, eco-friendly containers and wrappers. The reason for the three stars is because the brioche bun was dry (stale?) and it really impacted the sandwich in a big way. A fresh, soft bun makes a BIG difference! I would try this place again, but if I got another stale bun, I'd probably ask for a redo (even though I hate to be ""that gal\/guy"").",0,0,0

Our server took our menus and walked away, My wife and I sat there and waited for our food, wondering if our server was gonna come back and take our drink order or bring us chips and salsa like the other people dining inside got. NOPE the next time we saw our server was when she dropped off the bill. Another guy brought us our food. We still never ordered any drinks, because I walked to the nearby bar (outside the restaurant) and got myself a beer and my wife a strawberry daiquiri. As for the food. The Mexican Corn was okay. I mean its corn, how hard is it to mess up grilled corn. The Tortilla Soup was good. 
The flavor of the broth was the hit. It had the right amount of spice and warmth. Other then that the soup was full of soggy tortilla strips, and little amounts of chicken and veggies.

This place could totally pass for the experience and the drinks are probably cooler. Not to mention the DJ, gogo dancers, and table games make it cooler than anything Major Nelson experienced!

Lucky Bar has to be one of the coolest and comfortable bars out of just about any Las Vegas resort hotels I have been to in a while. The walls are covered in a draped red fabric with a cool glass beaded chandelier in the center of the room that seems to take its design cue from many places throughout the red rock property. Described as more ultra lounge than bar I think it accurately depicts the atmosphere. Cool enough to take date and no real dance floor to speak of means my funky white boy moves will have to be saved for later.  Still great place for conversations with friends, people watching, or meeting people out.

I tried the ""Lucky Me"" drink which had a great taste with a really spicy finish to it that hit the spot. Their cocktail menu includes all the usual suspects but, dont be afraid to try the ""Tuaca Drop"" which is a nice spin on the old favorite Lemon Drop.

It's very American of me to want more cheese on everything though, especially when the cuts of oxtail were surprisingly large and juicy. If I could change them, I would put curds of cheese, more like the amount found in poutine and shred the oxtail pieces into the gravy to make them easier to eat and share. 

My dining companion had the burger with an egg, bacon, and pimiento cheese on it. It was giant and difficult to hold and eat - I would suggest offering to cut it in two or sending a knife that's up to the challenge out with the burger. I tried a bite -- it was delicious, but very messy due to its size and construction. 

I had the chicken and waffles and while I was initially concerned about anise being added to the syrup (I don't like licorice flavors), I tried it and it added a depth of flavor to counteract the sweetness of the syrup while being otherwise unoffensive. The chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy inside a crispy crust of breading. The waffle was made with cornmeal, which helped make it less like a typical breakfast waffle.

They forgot quite a few things that we ordered and we had to keep asking. The sever wasn't apologetic at all when we asked our missing orders.

Food 

1. Salmon tacos (3.5\/5): it was average. Nothing really special about it. 
2 . Rock shrimp with yuzu sauce (3.5\/5): it was average too. Nothing great about this either. Kinda like honey walnut shrimp but not as good. 
3. Catalina Island uni (4.5\/5): I love uni from Catalina island. They have pretty fresh ones here. 
4. Chilean sea bass (3.5\/5): the cilantro dressing was not flavorful enough for me. Sea bass was fresh. 
5. Truffle bone marrow (4\/5): it was pretty good except it was bit salty for my taste and I couldn't use any of the seasoning that came with cuz it was bit salty already. 
6. Japaneiro fried rice: (4\/5): it was pretty good combination fried rice.

That's a pretty great deal, and the pot pie was really delicious - not to mention the banana cream pie she had (her favorite)!

I had chicken piccatta, which was surprisingly amazing.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I had the salad bar with it, which wasn't exciting - I would say that the selection could use some work.

I realize that dim sum is usually a lunch meal, but it is advertised for dinner as well at Saigon Saigon. When we came in we were given a print off of all the dim sum items that were sold out. It turned out that most of what we wanted was on that list, but we decided to persevere and try new things. After we waited about half an hour our order was finally taken, and then 5 minutes later the waitress came back and told us 3 of the things we ordered were now sold out as well. This happened one more time before we could finally secure our dinner order. *whew* Once the food came it was delicious. Everything we got was cooked perfectly and didn't disappoint. Trying to order dessert however was another fail and required us flagging down a manager after waiting another half an hour on that. We never did get a drink refill either, although the mandarin speakers at the table next to us seemed to get prompt service.

Owner looks like he beats up people.  He has black eyes, bruising all over the face.

I call at 9 this morning to see if they are open.   I was told yes and was asked a few questions about my dog.   Then I was asked if I could wait and bring her in at noon.  So I said yes.

I go there at noon.  The place is a madhouse.  The owner comes over and I tell him that I called at nine and was told to come in between noon and 1.    He looks at my dog and says ""Well.. she has to be shaved.""  I said ""Yes, I know.  Is there a problem?

Somethings wrong with you!   Get her dog!  Get her dog out of here!  We arent going to groom your dog, something is wrong with you for asking those questions!""

I ask the groomer if there was a problem because he is telling me that she is matted and he thinks that is a bad question to ask a groomer?  So he makes one of his employees go get my dog.  He says ""If you are going to ask those questions, I am not going to do your dog!""    

I cant believe it.  I have done NOTHING wrong, except ask if everything is ok.  To ask if they have a problem.  I am trying to be NICE and he thinks I am being mean?   Fruit case!   

I look at the dogs they have there, and realise its smart if I leave because the cuts look horrific!   I tell the guy ""I dont know what is wrong with you!  I simply asked if everything was ok.. you are telling me there are problems with my dog, and I already knew that.  I am sick,  I have just gotten out of the hospital because I have cancer and its taken me two weeks to get down here and you are going NUTS for no reason!""

I was very disappointed by their sweet selection. Not only was it overpriced, the chocolate fountains were very oily. For those that don't know, if you don't have enough cocoa butter in your chocolate, you must add veggie oil to it to make the fountain flow. They had too much in there and both of us could taste it.

Everyone was dressed business casual and the restaurant was busy but not full and loud.  We were seated and then our friendly server informed us how the restaurant worked.  It was a buffet of appetizers and sides and then you were to flip a card from red to green to have the servers bring you different selections of meat.  

I started with the sides.  I skipped the salads although they looked tasty carbs were calling my name.  I choose to start with some sushi, cheese, lobster mashed potatoes and shrimp cocktail.  The sushi roll I had was topped with what appeared to be Frenches Onion straws and it was excellent.  Great flavor and perhaps not traditional (although I am not a sushi expert) it was the best I have ever had.  What was also wonderful was the lobster mashed potato.  When I scooped a spoonful onto my plate I was surprised to find and entire section of claw meat.  They definitely did not skimp on the lobster.  

When we flipped to green and began getting our meat it was all very good.  My favorite was the filet.  I had it with bacon wrapped around it but I was more interested in the flier which was tender melt in your mouth.

Some things to keep in mind for next time....The meat was very salty.  I kind of got sick of it after a few rounds.  The potatoes although filled with lobster were also very saltily.  I am a big fan of salt but on the meat it was just too much.  Also the meat was always medium or close to rare a few times.

This is my fourth time having this cake and I am extremely disappointed that it was not on par with my previous experiences!

I arrived around 7:30PM as I was in the area for dinner.. wanted to grab a cake or two before dinner in case they were sold out\/closed afterwards.

When I got inside, again, arriving to the usual empty display case, no menu, nothing. I had to ask what flavours were available. The girl told me there was only original (I saw them cooling off, so I asked how long it would be).. and that they would be ready in 5 minutes. I bought one original and we waited for a few minutes, she offered us bottled water\/coffee which was at the front of the store.

I received the cake ~5 minutes later. When I was sitting in the restaurant..I put my hand on top of the box..the cake was definitely still warm to touch and steaming.. the cardboard box was getting soggy at the bottom from the moisture\/heat.

Approximately two hours later when I got home, I tried to cut a piece (at this time, it was no longer warm).. the cake literally caved.. either it was not baked enough or the steam had completely ruined it. I popped it in the fridge overnight and tried it this morning...slightly better,  the taste is great but it came down to a crumble.. literally a pile of spongy mush that I should be eating with a spoon.

Additionally, as other Yelpers have said, there was no ""logo"" stamp on the cake; seems like they are seriously slacking.

Overall, very very disappointed.. the taste is definitely still there but if I wanted zero presentation and texture..I may get more satisfaction from eating a spoon of nutella.",5,2,1

The salad was eh. Cranberries and nuts and gorgonzola cheese yet it didn't have much flavor. How is that?

V5pCyeSYVsowNyqibEGUUQ,4W5mSphlwe6_enJP5uo5SA,3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg,4,2016-02-06,"I revisited Dominick's again in January 2016. Once again, it was a cold evening, as per usual. We were seated pool-side again. I didn't expect for the heaters to work so I brought a big coat and a scarf, but really--my question remains: WHY DON'T THEY TURN ON THE HEATERS???? I have dined at many establishments that have partial outdoor set-ups and they always have their heaters humming. I even took the time to email management about this situation to find out what their answer was. I haven't received a reply. It just ticks me off when customer service drops off. Once you've dined, they no longer seem to care...

The Food: Was delicious. It was as good as the first time I dined. I have no complaints about that. My steak was better than many other ""big steakhouses"" I've been to in 2015. You can read my other reviews to know where I stand on various restaurants that specialize in cow.

The Service: Good except for the lie about turning on the heaters. The waiter agrees to do it and then walks away. He just figures you'll forget by time the food arrives I guess. I don't like being lied to in any area of my life.

Tips about where to sit: The upstairs isn't just COLD in the winter months, but there are other factors to consider. If you want to have a romantic evening or even a nice conversation with your dining partner, I would recommending sitting elsewhere. The problem with the upstairs location is that is where large parties are seated, along one wall. We had the good fortune (NOT) of being next to a table full of haughty 20-something Scottsdale children who were loud, unrefined, and basically an embarrassment to my gender. I was taught good manners for restaurants. I guess this is a demonstration of the ""everyone gets a trophy"" society that we live in. I was appalled at the drunken chatter emanating from this table. I knew EVERYTHING about this 23 year old girl by time they left: age, marital status, that she was no longer on her parents' insurance or phone bill (IMAGINE THAT?). Thus, if you'd rather be insulated from Scottsdale's Finest, I recommend requesting a table elsewhere in the restaurant.

Reservations: Don't show up early. You will NOT be seated one minute before your time has arrived.

To those commenting on the music: Yup, it's a pretty lame mix. I'd rather have nothing than that.",0,1,0

Apparently business is not doing too good because they seem to be reducing quantities especially in the drink category. My wife and I ordered martinis and I have never seen such small glasses. The wine glasses are also much smaller that they used to be.  Service was mediocre at best. The steamed rice was not warm so we sent it back to be heated. Instead of doing as we asked the waitress brought a new serving of rice that wasn't any warmer than the original serving. We visited on a Saturday night and there was hardly anyone else there.

I had zero expectations for Lolo's and it had nothing to do with the restaurant itself but the restaurant atmosphere in Scottsdale. Lots of marginally good food at OKAY prices. 

I live in N Scottsdale so going to Lolo's has to be a planned event especially since they close at 9pm on a Saturday night. I perused to online menu and decided on a Betty Boop and a slice of Red Velvet cake. I sashayed in. Couple of families and couples, some guys sitting at the counter. The hostes was pleasant asked me if I was dining in or getting take out. I told her takeout she handed me a menu and directed me to the counter to place my order. The young lady was nice. I ordered and saddled up to the bar and waited for my food.

The patrons were quiet and the plates I saw were clean. this a good sign, it means people were too busy stuffing their faces to engage in idle chatter. 

I probably waited about 6 minutes. They called my name I grabbed my food and headed back up the road.

I knew I was not eating my meal right away and had to stop at the store first do by the time I got home the food was cool. I threw the chicken and waffle in the oven to reheat for a few minutes.

The waffle darkened up a little but didn't dry out neither did the chicken breast. 

I de-boned the chicken took off the skin that wasn't crispy(I don't eat chicken skin unless it is cooked to a point where I can't tell that it is chicken skin) Added my condiments and went to town. It was a solid meal. 

I'd go back to Lolo's again if I were in the area. I probably wouldn't make a special trip from home again, but I had to give the place a try. 

Oh and the Red Velvet cake was good. Not fabulous but good.",1,1,0

The food took about 10 minutes to come out which was not too bad. The gas on their portable cooking top was running low and the cooking was really slow. Finally after we switched to a new bottle of propane we got cooking normally. After a few rounds we noticed half of the beef on a new plate were a bit grayish and dried up. We thought they might be some leftovers from other tables but we were ok with it as long as nobody touched them. At 11:35 we asked for one more round of pork and they refused.

The new dentist took over about a year ago and all the existing staff has been replaced. I called the office and made an appointment for a crown two weeks ago. I scheduled a day off work and arrived at the office on the appointed day and time and found that I wasn't on the schedule. The receptionist asked when I called, like that would make a difference in why they didn't book the appointment. They didn't have me down for another day or time, they just didn't make the appointment when I called. They pulled my chart and started to think about what to do when the phone rang and the receptionist dropped my chart to schedule an appointment with the phone caller. I found this to be exceptionally rude considering that she muffed my appointment. I left the office without being served. I did not want the dentist to ""squeeze"" me into the schedule for this type of procedure. I called office later and the receptionist said she called my cell phone right after I left the office and talked to me and told me I should come back. I told her that she did not talk to me and she insisted she did and told me the number she called, a number that started with area code 419. My area code is 440, same as the office.

 To sum up, the office didn't make an appointment when I called for one, ignored me to answer the phone and make an appointment for someone else when I was standing right in front of them, and had the wrong phone number on my chart.

(Which made me wonder if I had even been processed as checked in)  I watched the huge waiting room fill and empty twice before I was called back for my turn.   Waiting for an appointment for an hour an a half is not acceptable....in any circumstance.  I had an appointment which was scheduled in advance. Please respect my time. Im not sure why the medical field gets away with this crap.  It's not an e.r. you people do this everyday and should know how to mange your time and your staff.  The only redeeming quality was the back office staff. I saw two different techs, both were very professional and efficient and did a great job.  I also liked that they did not make u wait for results and told you on site.  As far as time management....get your act together!",4,0,2

The problem was: It IS a pretentious nightmare of douchebag hipsters. Douchebag trust-fund hipsters, to be precise. What we had enjoyed briefly, thinking for some reason that everyone was in on the irony, was quickly revealed to be entirely literal. The simplest way to describe it: Bellagio is old money. Cosmo is new money. 

The Marquee Day Club is modeled after South Beach clubs, with beds and bottle service and fake boobs perched on anorexic ribs and tanning bed tans and life-of-leisure abs. The ""attitude"" is as thick as the Pour Homme. Basically, douchebag mating grounds. 

Our wrap-around terrace suite was absolutely lovely (1887) with a commanding view of the Strip and the Bellagio fountains. Yet little things were...off. The towels were rough. The washcloths worn. There was no trashcan in the kitchen, nor a coffee maker. The bedroom phone cord had been ripped out. The robes were cuddly soft, though. 

My husband was genuinely freaked out by the uber-attitude, to the point where I think he was actually spoiling for a fight (you can take the boy outta da Bronx....). I reminded him that we were in THEIR world, that it was WE who had to adapt or die, that they were all behaving in exactly the appropriate manner for who they are. Please, thank you, excuse me...all as foreign to them as thrift stores and coupons.

Next year? Back to Bellagio, where pretention is the frosting on a classy, moist cake, not the acai berry in the small-batch vodka of the month cocktail.",14,10,12

I always get the egg waffles and order them extra crispy because it gives them a nice slightly burnt sugar taste, and the extra super crispiness gives them a great texture. They've always been $3 for one egg waffle, and $5 for two even though the price of the ice cream sandwich has crept up a bit.

Okay so there's a little secret to this place, if you ask them, they will put chocolate chips in your egg waffle. You can also wrap your ice cream in the egg waffle too (I think it was $6?). It's sooo good, and so much cheaper than the $8 they cost at night market. 

They make their egg waffle and ice cream sandwich batter on site, throughout the day, as they need it. Almost every time I come here, there is either someone cracking eggs or beating them for a new batch of batter. I'm not sure if the other place uses eggs at all.

Sometimes they have a really really long line up, especially on weekends and holidays, so you might need to wait a bit for your egg waffle!",0,0,0

We went to look at some outdoor furniture and checked out some bicycles and got myself a game head phone at the Best Buys.  We were feeling Sushi for dinner and I'm always happy to try new Sushi places.  My husband got a recommendation from his friend because this sushi place have Korean foods too.  We arrived there little after 6pm and my husband ordered Bento with Spicy Chicken and I ordered appetizer Baked Mussels and Caterpillar rolls.  I know we said we were feeling sushi but menu looks so good, so we changed our mind to some cooked items.  

I enjoyed my hot cup of green tea and checked this restaurant out.  I like the decor but did not like how open the bathroom was.  I wish they had a screen or something so that bathroom is not so easily viewed.  And I noticed there was a lady who might be owner or manager who was very busy talking to customers going from table to table asking if everything was okay and just chatting with the customers.  That is always a good sign.   Then about 10mins my husband's food came out.  I thought that was strange since Appetizer wasn't out.  So we picked at his food while waiting for other foods to come out.  Spicy chicken was sooo salty and there was almost no chicken.  It was mostly vegetables.  I do how ever liked their octopus salad.  It was refreshing and yummy. We waited... and waited... and we were eating really slow  but my food still didn't come out.  Well after we were done with his bento our waiter asked how was everything.  He asked that like if that's all we ordered. Then he notice I was not happy, actually I was mad so he ask if I ordered anything. 

HELLO! You took my order!!!  I said yes I ordered appetizer and a roll.  He said he'll check on it, didn't even apologize.  Then comes back and said the baked mussels were in the oven and they always take time so it'll be another 5 mins and he'll get the rolls.  Rolls comes out like 15 or 20 mins later and I am fuming.  I was tire, and just exhausted from this waiting.  The lady finally comes to our table and asked if everything was okay and if we need a water or tea.  I said no thank you and my husband ask if our appetizer is done yet?  She said she'll check and then another waitress comes and asked if everything was okay.  My husband asked again regarding the mussels and she comes back and said it will be about 5 mins because baking takes time.  When mussels finally arrived at our table I was done.  I asked for to go box for those mussels and paid.  We even gave them 20% tip when they deserve nothing.  I just wanted to go home.  When we got to our car which was parked right front of the restaurant it was already 7:40pm.  So my mussels took more then 50mins to cook???  As you can see I didn't eat the mussels.  The mussels that is ""supposedly"" cooked for over 50mins was not fully cooked.  I don't know why but outside the mussels were warm but inside was cold.  Like it was frozen or something.  I couldn't eat it so I throw it away.  I was soooo disappointed.  I love baked mussels.  We will never go back and just told our friend who recommend this place what happened.",2,2,0

It happens, and the server was great so I didn't mind going up to the bar for a drink waiting for service to catch up.

I asked for an orange vodka (goose or ketel) on the rocks from Raul the bartender who didn't know what products he had.  He finally found a smirnoff orange and poured me 2 on the rocks.  I had asked for an orange vodka with 2 rocks.  My bad for not saying ice, I guess.  I drank them both.

I asked him which wine was dryer, the chianti or Sangiovese and he started to pour me a taste of the cab which I pointed out wasn't a Sangiovese or chianti.  I spotted carmenere and ordered that.  When I got the bar tab it said 2 absolute instead of smirnoff.  I asked him if he could adjust the check and he said there was no button for smirnoff and he couldn't adjust the price.  Really Raul?  There's no smirnoff button?  And Absolute and smirnoff are not in the same price range.  Fine, I paid and went back to my party.  

Frutti di Mare was bland and the pasta wasn't drained well so it was watery.  2 more who had pasta said theirs was Bland as well.  Caesar salad was fine, unmemorable. Good wine by the glass list.  Waitress was friendly and competent, and very busy.  No manager was ever present.

Curious, I asked her if there was a button in the aloha system that they used to order smirnoff.  There was and she said raul was the manager.  Awesome.  Clearly an unloved restaurant.

Took son here he was very excited;we are from los angeles and love pinball games, and there are zero arcades were we live. (such a small city of 10 million people hard to find one)
++++:
-very close and accessible from strip via car---simply take tropicana down past UNLV
-great selection of games
-never crowded
-10 to 20 bucks lasts hours if you play well
-restroom inside (smells like shit but its a restroom)
-sodas and popcorn vending machine inside
-lots of morons forget free games or balls, mustve picked up at least 12-15 free games just like that in 2 days! Keep your eyes on the screen for credits, hey why not be proud to be a game-cheeser.
-supposedly profits go to charity, instead of crooked white-collar vegas brass.

minuses:
-Repairman\/owner is a dick...asked him politely to reset a pinball game that didnt work properly, he shut machine down saying it was broken and told us to pick another game. After 5 seconds he snapped ""quickly""--what a pedophile jerk-off.
-very dark inside. Can barely see except for the pinball lights keeping place lit.
-lots of games are not working properly, i.e. terminator2 had lots of lights and point areas not working, or some flippers weak. And it seems most games rigged I played certain machines in L.A. for much longer than they last here. Lots of balls get stuck a lot, have to tilt the machine and risk losing entire game.
-must have played over a hundred games maybe 3-4  match replays awarded only. more rigging.
-most of the fun new games cost 75 cents a play. only the crappy 1950 games are 25 cents, and those suck beyond belief.
-back area looks like a junkyard, clean it up or put up a drywall man.

I had a drink too, can't remember what it was (something like a watermelon margarita with a spicy salt rim) but it was pretty darn tasty...and strong! My friend even treated us to tequila at the end of the meal. We were really impressed. I'm not a big tequila aficionado or anything, but my friend knows a thing or two and chose a good one.

Appetizers:
1) sea scallops- came with 3 large scallops which were perfectly cooked; however the taste was lacking. It had a very light lemony butter taste but it just didn't stand out. I would not order this again.

2) wagyu tartare- this was one of my favorites. Delicious and flavored just right. Came with plenty of crostini to spread that delicious meat on. If you like tartare- try it!

3) rib eye steak- very big disappointment!! It was more than $50 and came lukewarm. Seasoned and cooked well but the temperature really killed it. It was also way too fatty and we had to cut large chunks of fat out to eat it. I love my fat but it was just too much.

4) braised short ribs- this was very flavorful and tender. I wish it came with some sort of starch to balance it out. Eating this by itself was a bit too salty and it was difficult to eat a lot of it.

5) risotto side dish- I really liked this one with red corn, prosciutto and cilantro. Great flavors and risotto cooked just right!

Pros:
* many wonderful flavours and lots of choice.  (Just be warned the vindaloo is very, very spicy).
* the garlic naan was scrumptious.

Cons:
* None of the entrees come with naan\/rice.  Each entree comes in a small metal bowl that is about 3 in diameter and 1.5 in height.  So that's about $11 for a tiny bowl of vegetables or about $15 for a few little cubes of meat in a bit of sauce.
* The waiter is a bit pushy about asking you to order more entrees and rice\/naan than you think you need.
* In the end, we were full but mostly due to the naan and water (remember the spicy vindaloo!) not from the tiny entrees.
* When we made the reservation, they insisted we come 1 hr earlier even though the restaurant was not full at our desired time.  (We read similar reviews from other diners).

Food:  I had the combo for 5.99 which included a beef short rib bao, roasted red pepper soup and a pop.  I found the bao to be okay with a mixture of tang\/pickle-ness and sweet beef.  However, for me, the taste didn't blow me away.  Maybe it's because I thought it was small and was expecting to be blown away, but I wasn't. It was okay, 2.5\/5.  As for the roasted red pepper soup, this was absolutely delicious.  You could taste all the veggies.  4\/5.

As soon as I saw a brief mention of this place on the talk pages of Yelp Pittsburgh, I monitored their progress towards opening by ""liking"" their page on facebook. It finally opened while I was out of town, so I made it a point to try this place as soon as I got back.  Walking back from school yesterday (Monday), I walked up and realized that they're not open on Mondays.  So I tried again today.

The brightly painted walls of this place remind me of a traditional mexican restaurant.  When you first walk in, their gelato lies in a similar position where Mercurio's gelatos used to lie.  From the end of the table, I ordered two tacos to go - one al pastor and the other carnitas.  They offer a number of salsas, and it seems that you can pack your own, even though they initially ask whether you want any one in particular.

While i waited, i sampled the mojito gelato (""with real booze""), one of their many interestingly flavors.  It was surprisingly light and tasty, although there were quite a few ice crystals in my sample because the lady scooped from the surface.  I'll most likely try a cup of this the next time I come back; it has just the right lightness that I like for a summer snack\/dessert.

My order was fulfilled in a reasonable time (there was only one other party that had finished eating already).  I walked home as quickly as I could so that I could enjoy my tacos while they were still warm and so that the juices from the meat wouldn't soak through the corn tortilla.  My only thought on the walk back was, ""I hope they put two corn tortillas, unlike reyna foods...""

And there were two corn tortillas!  The tacos aren't fully decked out like the ""super tacos"" of small mexican joints - as seen in the pictures, they provide the meat and some diced onions\/cilantro. no lettuce, tomato, or any of that stuff. I asked for a bit of their medium house salsa, which came on the side. it was very mild for my taste (I could barely taste any spicyness), so I'll be trying their next level up next time I go.  The carnitas was slightly dryer than I expected, which eliminated the soggy corn tortilla problem.  The corn tortilla had cooled down, and I think it would have tasted better if left on the griddle slightly longer.  The pineapple on the al pastor taco definitely helped the taste a bit, but like the carnitas, they were just a tad underseasoned.   They put one salsa cup in my bag, which I ran out after 1.5 tacos, which meant that I barely had any salsa for my chips.  So if you get your order to go, make sure you have enough salsa! The chips that were also provided in a small bag was a nice accompaniment to my tacos. Thumbs up for not putting much salt on them. For two tacos my meal came out to be ~7.50, which is high\/very high for the standard, but based on location (being in shadyside), I understand their pricing, and I don't have much to complain about.  I hope they'll have those spicy pickled veggies (Carrots, jalapenos, onions etc) soon! those will definitely be a great condiment for the tacos in addition to solely salsa.

Based on my review, I may just be accustomed to slightly heavier tastes (more spicyness, more spices).  Go and try this place! This places deserves to stay around.",3,0,0

We went on a Friday night and it was definitely packed but not packed enough where it was uncomfortable. After awhile we were able to score some seats at the bar and take in the scenery. The place's decor looks like a cross between a cafe in havana, a hookah bar and a kitchen out of the Wonder Years. It's very eclectic and holds a bunch of personality.

I was on a mission for a chocolate stout and was given a great recommendation by the bartender about a local brew called Oscar. Upon my first sip, I confirmed his praise for the beer and asked for another recommendation. He warned that Fuel Cafe had a smoky coffee flavor and he was right on. Unfortunately, smoky and me didn't mix. I guess he noticed I didn't fancy it so much so he recommended a Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout for no charge. I tasted that one and I was back in stout heaven.  Such great personable service!

At the end of the night the bill came out to a measly $13 for 3 microbrews. It's a great place to chill out, have a lil convo and have the jukebox tunes playing in the background. Plus having knowledgeable bar staff is a star in itself. So far this is my favorite bar in Madison!",1,1,2

When he returned to take our food order he again tried to leave without asking about drinks, even though 1 in our party ordered coffee. I caught him and ordered the drinks. The meatball app and the mushroom apps were outstanding, lots of flavor, the reason it gets 2 stars. We thought if this is an indication the dinner should be great. The lasagna was flavorless and totally ""unremarkable"" per 1 in my party. If there was ricotta cheese in it it was old and lost all flavor. He said he could only taste the noodles, everything else had no taste. Another had the salmon special, salmon with a white coating over risotto. Salmon just OK, risotto no flavor, no seasoning and undercooked, stuck to your teeth and a little crunchy. The eggplant parm was NOWHERE near the flavor of the lunch serving. Flavor was bland and seemed undercooked, WAY too much cheese, not enough flavor. My steak milinase was steak beaten flat, to remove all taste, and coated with something that did not have much flavor and didn't accent the steak at all, tasted kind of like Sizzler chicken fried steak, with less coating and less flavor. Toward the middle of the meal someone, again name unknown,  not even sure he worked there, asked how our dinner was.

I'm sure most of you J-Town fanatics have been here before in this semi Food Court setting in a serve-self dining area where you pour your own Water but at least you'll notice it's next to the tap with a Brita filter on it while when you finish the meal you put your own dishes and garbage away(think Ikea).

#8 Udon with Tempura Shrimp($7.98) had a good Kombu stock, slurpy chewy Udon, a couple Fish Cake slices, Shrimp Tempura, and a Shitake.  The Shrimp Tempura was a funny item as you know what to expect when Tempura gets wet but I ordered it knowing of this fact but the look of this Tempura was very good if I imagine it prior to the soaking.

Upon being impressed by the Udon, Broth, Fish Cake.  I was additionally surprised by how perfectly cooked the Shrimp was inside the Tempura and had just the perfect bite that all Shrimp should have.  Wait....  There's more, that unassuming Shitake that looks like a Shitake and you don't expect much from it?  It had such good flavour as I believe it must have been marinaded in some sort of Shoyu sauce.

All things considered, this meal was very good for the price and this cool Fall weather as the broth came out steaming hot.  Also on a sidenote, I believe this would be a good Vegetarian choice or just leave out the Shrimp and go for the Tofu($6.98) or Plain($5.98) options.",5,2,3

I hate when I come home to review a place tho, and see that everyone else liked it.  Then I have to wonder, is it me?  Am I too particular?  Anyway, judging by many other reviews, it is not just me.  I ordered a very basic bacon and eggs with white toast.  My friend ordered a plain waffle.  Waffle was cold.  Twice.  Butter didn't even melt on it.  There was one tiny dish of syrup, that barely covered half the waffle.  My bacon was undercooked, sunnyside up eggs were broken and the toast was whole wheat, when I ordered white.  And they only serve one slice.  Who doesn't serve 2 slices of toast with breakfast?  Wait, this gets comical.  So I asked her for white toast.  No problem.  She brings back white toast.  Then I see it's not buttered.  I then asked for buttered white toast.  Then she says I'll bring you some butter, as we only serve dry toast here.  If that's the case, then shouldn't they say something in advance?  Not everyone eats dry toast.  I said then the toast will be cold, socan you please make me fresh, hot toast and butter it in the kitchen?  She said they only have a butter oil liquid mix, so I'd probably not want that, but that she would bring me hot toast with butter on the side.  I said fine.  That order comes burnt with rock hard butter on the side.  I said can I please have white toast that is not burnt with butter that isn't hard like a rock, so I could spread it.  She said sure, she will try again.  So I get white toast, at last, not burnt, not buttered, but now with melted butter on the side.  Really.  A dish of totally melted butter.   Anyway, needless to say it took 4 times to get the toast order correct, and even then, it was served with liquid butter.  Pathetic.  If you can't fry an egg and not break it, and you can't serve hot, buttered toast, how can you claim to be a breakfast restaurant?

In retrospect, this was probably our mistake, but we were being spontaneous.

The web site does say that you should make reservations, but we had some issues with doing so - so we just stopped in instead, since when we left the house, there was plenty of room in our preferred room.

As is mentioned, the rooms are set aside by number of participants, and because of that, you might end up with people you don't know, unless you book the whole room, and then pay a no-show fee for any ""missing"" people (currently half the going rate, which could be expensive if there are only say two of you). It all depends on how open you are to meeting new people.

An interesting way to solve this might be to have the same number of people (8, 10, whatever) and multiple ways to solve the room - then if people don't know each other - or even if they do, they could actually be in competition. That would be interesting.

Anyway, when it comes to the room, it's likely to be a challenge. Some items may seem straightforward, and some may seem to be difficult - it's likely that you'll notice things and miss others entirely, but that's why you are given a walkie-talkie, and encouraged to try and figure things out for yourself, at least at first. After a while, the staff is there to help, even giving clues as needed to point you in the right direction (they aren't going to give you the answers, but point you towards them). Unlike some other rooms we've tried, they don't charge you, which is nice.

With a success rate of somewhere between 10-20% (presumably dependent on which room you're in, it's definitely worth trying if you like puzzles.

Decided to check it out again thinking more bang for our buck. Well, waitress Deonna was great. She let us know that the grits would take 9 mins and we could pick a side. I ordered the lil C, Which comes with grits  And 2 pieces of chicken I got a leg and if I my husband ordered the waffles eggs and grits. So the sides that we ordered was the red beans and rice and I got the smothered potatoes which they were in small side bowls. Chicken was lukewarm when we got it but it was tasty and had great flavor. We were expecting the grits but had to ask for them. Grits come in a container that is barely 1\/2 full. It was supposed to be both orders. Icing on my cake, asked for manager who never came out to talk to us. Cook tried to make up for it with a fuller container of grits and a few pieces of fresh chicken. Am I going back? Probably not. Just curious, if he made fresh grits, gave me two tablespoons of it, who were the rest of the grits for? Oh btw, grits were runny watery and probably will taste like shit. Never again Lolo's, never again. Save your money and go to M&M soul food. At least I will get a full order the first time.",0,0,0

They took over from an Italian chain. When they first opened, everything was cool: attentive, friendly, even enthusiastic servers, good food and beer, good prices. Gradually, it appears that the managers\/staff who originally opened the place have moved on. The result has been (in general) inconsistent service and food. 

There are still a couple of great servers there, and if you get one of them, you'll have a pleasant experience. This past week, I ordered a chicken burrito for part of my meal; the burrito itself was fine but the sauce tasted disconcertingly like Ragu spaghetti sauce. (it should be noted, though, that they have the best salsa in town that I've found so far!) To top off the general decline, they raised their prices a couple of months ago.  As time passes, I'm finding fewer and fewer reasons to go back. Aside from hiring more enthusiastic servers, the one thing they could do to get back on track would be to get a little inventive with the menu. There's really nothing there that's different from any other Mexican restaurant in town, and what is different does not taste distinctive. How about getting back to basics -- street tacos, tortas, tlayudas, tostados?",0,0,0

Overall, nice gourmet truffles with interesting ingredients but lacking complexity in taste (both in chocolate and filling). Not the best I've had, but they were all still good.

And I searched the area for a good restaurant that is not expensive. I read the reviews about pan asian and got convinced to try it and with the $20 for $10 deal it sounds really good. 

We got there and greeted by the owner, very pleasing and smiling all the time, felt very welcomed. It's fish Friday so I ordered mostly seafood. Menu prices are all less than $10 but when the food arrived they look so fancy and elegant. I was really impressed and the taste is very good, not your typical Asian cooking where it taste good coz of MSG ... this one, their food taste good because it's fresh and true flavors of the ingredients. My hubby who is not a foodie like me was very impressed too and could not stop eating and after each bite he literally say ""this is so good"" in each bite he takes. 

Even if this is far from our house, we would definitely go back here and buy more of the coupon deal. Calamari is very good, crunchy breading that is just the right amount of coating. Pad Thai is amazing, not the usual yellowish flat noodles in other thai resto, but the flavors are so good together I can eat the noodles by itself even without the meat which means even if I order chicken or shrimp pad Thai I'm sure it will still be very good.

On word of mouth, I decided to try it anyway.  It is a lovely space, nautical theme, Cape Cod inspired, but doesn't really make sense given the menu seems French inspired.  

We went for the Sunday Brunch, were seated promptly, and the wait staff were attentive and friendly.  That was the best part, but staff can't make up for mediocre food.  I ordered a mixed green salad and a savory crepe, the waiter promptly returned to let me know my main dish came with a salad and he would cancel my salad order.  Like I said the service was not a problem.  My main course was good, not great, the crepe was well done but the dish was not balanced, it lacked the special something that makes a meal great.  I was planning on giving Garfield's 3-stars until...

It was my anniversary, so we splurged with desert.  One of my favorites was on the menu, tart tartan.  It was not good.  If you are familar with the dessert it has a crisp pastry crust with thinly sliced apples and has a scope of ice cream.  Their version had huge chunks of apples and was drenched in some kind of honey sauce so the pastry was soggy and the whole dessert was sickly sweet.  

My husband and I also had two mimosa's each and our final bill was over $90.  Not that we are cheap diner's, but for that much we would like to be blown away or at least have a decent meal.  My husband didn't enjoy his meal either, but I'll let him tell his own story.

Suggestions to Garfields...
1.  Add your times of business on your website.
2.  Replace huge portions with better quality.  Or just make your portions smaller and charge less.
3.  Pick a style and stick with it.  I was very confused as to what style of food or theme your restaurant has.  Cape Cod?  English? French? Fusion?  I'm just not sure.
4.  Include better descriptions on your menu.  We we were very unclear what sides went with entrees.  If you advertise tart tartan, but include your own twist from the traditional, then you need to state that.",7,1,3

As I have mentioned in my other reviews I love Japanese food. First thing I did moving to Edinburgh was to check out all the different choices of restaurants, a lot more exciting from Dundee.  Lolz.

It was trip adviser I think, had such high rating for Bonsai, I didn't even hesitate and just went for it. 

The restaurant is quite small not the smallest now that Ive been to Sushiya.., the decor was...very trying to be Japanese style? Tokyo Style?..

Anyway the key point here is the food.  In simple words
I hated it. 

I ordered Takoyaki..its octopus balls (I know...dont laugh...its not like it's really octopus balls)..it was frozen in the middle. Told the waiter, then after a minute or so I heard micowave beeping...great...I told them not to bother bringing it back.  

Ordered King prawn tempura.   When it arrived.  Both me and my friend went quiet and stared at the prawns. Whoever thats ever had tempura would know...the prawns are supposed to come out STRAIGHT!!!!!! Yep, it was all curled up like the ones you get from chinese restaurants in salt and chilli dishes? All I wanted was some STRAIGHT prawn tempura...how the xxxx do they get such high rating??? I had one bite. Batter was alright.  Tastes bland.

Then finally the maki rolls.  They seemed ok, I took a piece without even putting a whole piece in my mouth, the rice was freezing cold like it was just taken out from the fridge.  By that time I was raging with the service (we were the only table there, I could hear staff in kitchen having a loud laugh and the service was quite terrible other than saying sorry they never asked was everything ok.) And the FOOD.
Could actually remember I felt my face and ears getting hotter....

So in 31yrs of my life. I've never once walked out of a restaurant with an extremely loud rumbling tummy empty stomach. Not that I think I will ever either. But I asked for the bill as calmly as I could...my friend sitting opposite me was whispering in Chinese...""calm down its ok...calm down we go to blah blah blah and eat..."" yep. Hardly touched any of the food even returned the frozen balls. They charged us in full.  I had no interest in arguing or discussing anything or intention to stay in that restaurant any longer. So I paid and left. The full meal was still on the table.  

Never again

The only real complaint I have is that our bread was hard as a brick, and difficult to chew. Our entrees all came out hot and delciscious. I order the Shrimp Scampi and would definitley recommend it to others. My boyfriend is a big fan of the chicken picatta. 

One issue I did have, is that while our both was near the bar, I noticed a lady dressed in jeans and a tank top was seated there, then she was back in the kitchen.

I am sure DB's marketing target's but here is the issue. Shortly before 9:00 they begin clearing tables and chairs from the dance floor. Its this next step that killed it for us.
A member of security tells me I will have to give up my seat. Why?since we are at the back bar not anywhere where we,would impede dancing. It is explained that no one is allowed to sit once the music starts. We are told we could go to the restaurant area but that defeats the purpose of our visit. It appears that DB's policy is no chairs on Friday and Saturday nights for anyone. According to the manager is its about dancing and safety. Not sure I buy either one. I do not see how stools at a back bar causes issue to either. What I can say is this if you are unwilling to make accommodations for older clients then we spend our money elsewhere.

He had the Medieval and I had the Classical both a 1\/2 lb. and on whole wheat buns (medium-well). They were perfectly juicy and flavorful.  The sweet potato fries are yummy and my regular fries were pretty good but a tiny bit limp.  They have fresh brewed iced tea - 2 flavors today (2\/13\/11) and both were yummy.  The girl that brought our food out was very friendly and asked if she could get us anything...ranch, utensils, etc.

The place was a mess when we walked in and only 3 tables were full.  The workers seemed to be having a great time....maybe too much?!  I have to say that everyone was friendly, but there is some fine tuning needed at this place.  The bathrooms were pretty messy and the tables were dirty.  Some time after we sat down, one of the girls did come out and start cleaning but the tables still looked greasy.

This is the place you want to go if you want to experience old-school Vegas.  It's dirty, gritty and utterly low-class.  This is NOT shiny, sterile and plastic like the Strip.  This is Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Dean Martin-style Vegas.  I kept expecting to see Italian guys with Uzis popping out from behind the door telling me to ""fuhgeddaboudit"" with the Godfather theme music playing in the background.

I loved it here.

We stayed in room #211 at the Golden Gate over the week of March 11th.  For the most part, we enjoyed staying here, although there's always bad points wherever you go, so we'll just start with the not-so-good:

- The bathroom was definitely not a pleasant experience.  The door kept hitting the toilet bowl and you couldn't get the door opened all the way.  Not a huge negative, but it was kind of annoying after a while.
- It took some creative maneuvering to get the shower the way I wanted it.  It definitely tends to run either so hot that your skin boils off, or so cold that you'll turn into an ice cube.  Once you get used to it, though, you'll pull it off like a champ.  My last shower was much better than my first.
- The tub didn't really drain properly.  Kind of awkward to stand in a pool while you're showering.  I was worried for a while that it wouldn't drain out before I'd finished.  That needs to be taken care of, for sure.
- The casino was way... too... loud, even in (maybe even especially in) the mornings.  Seriously, no one needs the music turned up to 11.  We know we're in a casino, thanks.
- They need a bit more help with the valet parking.  There was only one guy manning the window most of the time and they're way too busy for that.
- Limited selection of cable channels.  News, sports and local stations is about all that's available.
- No free WiFi - it's 9.95 a day both here and at the D.  Come on, you guys - I know your hotel's cheap, but charging for WiFi?  Really?
- Self parking area closed off most of the time.  Annoying, as I don't like anyone in my car.

There's good here, though!

- Great location.  Right in the middle of the Fremont Street Experience, where most of the serious ""partiers"" show up.  Of course, if that's not your thing, you'll hate it here.  Make no mistake - this is a gritty, low-brow crowd. 
- Reasonable prices.  Even with the ""resort fee"" (which is totally STANDARD at vacation spots, the East Coast does it all the time), it was an absolute bargain.  Is it the Hilton? No.  Is it clean, comfortable and a good place to lay your head? Yes.  If you want Wynn-level service - go to the Wynn.
- Casino is a bit loose with the $.  You WILL win here if you persist.  
- Great restaurant downstairs (Dupar's.  See separate review).
- Friendly, helpful staff.  Even the single valet was really pleasant, despite being hurried.

Really, the bathroom and the WiFi were the only negatives here for us, and for the deal we got, I can overlook it.  

Our room overlooked the Plaza across the street, so the sound quality may be different elsewhere, but we never had an issue sleeping, even through the insanity on Fremont late at night.

Do be careful here, especially if you're female and single.  As stated - this can be a pretty unsavory area, especially at night.  I'm used to Baltimore's roughness, but most aren't conditioned.  Plan and act accordingly.

We'd stay here again.",6,3,3

It's a library. Apparently that doesn't mean what is once had.  

There are cool things about it like a media lab and cool-looking, hip design etc....

But...

This library is far too loud.

I've been waiting for months to enjoy a library-like environment in which to study. I don't think it's too much to ask as the word ""Library"" is posted on the front of the building.

I'm not the sort to complain. I truly am not, so it behooves me to give suggestions to rectify the problem. (Though your staff doesn't seem to think the noise is a problem. See below.)

Please consider the following suggestions:
- Post signs regarding acceptable noise levels
- Enforce these rules (the security guard sits and plays on his cell phone for 60 mins, walks around and then takes his spot, head down once more to play on his cellphone for another hour. Repeat. I watched it happen.)
- Stop the precident of noise being acceptable by enforcing the standard etiquette of libraries everywhere. 
- There are sound treatments out there (treatments the architech\/designer should have thought of) to keep the sound of conversational levels from travelling all the way to every corner of the space. Install them.

I was alarmed to hear from another commiserating library customer who was trying to study that her complaints got her responses such as, ""The days of quiet libraries are over."" 
If this is the case, then please post signs reading something to the effect of: ""Be advised, quiet space unavailable here."" or, ""Library Etiquette not observed here. For quiet, earplugs are available (for a nominal fee) at the counter.)

I understand that children's programs are traditionally (and rightfully so!) put on at community llilbraries but how can the staff and security stand (or sit, playing on their electronic devices) while kids are playing hide and seek in the stacks and people are carrying on loud, obnoxious conversations? I would not comment whatsoever if other library customers hadn't voiced their strong dissatisfaction themselves (quietly voiced, of course. This is a library after all.) 

Regarding the childrens programs: It was great to hear a dozen kids singing along to ""Skimmery Dinky Dink"" this morning. Really. But wow. It was like they were singing right next to the spot at which I was trying to study (a spot one floor away and on the other side of the building). I find it hard to imagine an architect\/designer making this space with apparently total disregard to the idea that the space will be shared with the other library customers, many of whom require quiet.

Unacceptable and very, very disappointing.

The week before we  had dinner at Mastros and Modern Steak, both of which were amazing. The Keg...terrible. I had the BBQ chicken & ribs. They were very very dry and when they came out it looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for 20 minutes. The ribs were super tough and hard to get off the bone. Taste was awful. My girlfriend had their filet on the special menu. She managed a steak restaurant so she definitely knows how to order...so she requested medium rare ""plus"" (between medium rare & medium). The waiter said they had an ""alarming"" amount of people send their steak back when ordering something special like a plus, so he encouraged her to go with medium rare. The only thing alarming was how undercooked the steak was. Beyond rare. Cold in the center, not even a little bit close to medium rare. The steak didn't have very good taste at all. The best thing we had was the twice baked potato. Also, it's funny that they call this restaurant The Keg and they only have like 6 beers on tap, no microbrews or interesting beers.

The main reason why I like this place is because it's the main true ramen restaurant in the north end of the city. Everything else is located downtown. In the north this place is competing against Kenzo Ramen, Kinton Ramen and Ajisen Ramen.

This place is not easy to find with the bare eye. It's right on Yonge and McKee, next to the korean H-Mart and across from Owl of Minerva. It's a small mom and pop restaurant covered in all wood. 

I happen to go when it was not busy and in a middle of a snow storm. It seats around 30 people with a wide open view of the kitchen. The menu selection is limited but enough to accompany the common customer. There are 4 ramen  choices: Hakata Tonkatsu (simple miso ramen), Black Tonkatsu (miso with black garlic flavour), Red Hot Tonkatsu (a tad spicier with korean spicy paste), Chashu Tonkatsu (same as Hakata Tonkatsu but with extra pork belly). The appetizer selection are also scarce with the simple edamame, chicken wings, fried chicken and soy based tofu. 

The ramen was thinner and (in my opinion) fit better with the soup base they are serving. The other locations have the typical thick ramen which just becomes too heavy for the meal. The soup base was fair and not too salty, which is why I think Kinton was not listed on top of this place. They give you 4 pieces of pork belly for all the ramen bowls except for Chashu Tonkatsu where they give you another 4 pieces. The soft boiled egg is good but not included with the meal and the yoke is soft. I hate it when I go to places and the egg is hard and overcooked and even worst if the yoke is cooked. That pisses me off the most.

There was a special where if you order an appetizer you can receive a Sapporo draft for $3.80. 

Overall this place is quick, clean and simple. Portions are fair and so is the pricing.

Highly recommend this place... just do it.",13,1,5

With all, the emphasis is on local and seasonal ingredients, deftly prepared to capitalize on intrinsic freshness and flavour.  Keriwa is an absolute standout in this regard: honestly some of the most exquisite food I've had in Toronto at any price.  I was impressed that the chef inquired about any dietary restrictions at the table, so that adjustments could be made.  (Lesser chefs in Toronto print on their menus that they will *not* make adjustments.)   The appetizer of smoked whitefish in dill crepes with 'hen of the woods' mushrooms managed to be light yet earthy.  The rainbow trout, served with heirloom tomatoes and pureed basil, was perfectly cooked.  Everything was beautifully presented on plates made from rustic slabs of wood. For dessert we had the spiced apple pie with vanilla ice cream, which tasted genuinely homemade--  really large slice by the way, so plan to share this if you try it.  Keriwa also offers some delicious & novel cocktails.  The table service left a little to be desired, though not for lack of ambition.  They seemed keen to explain menu options and consult on wines etc., but this kept them too busy to attend to the basics. It won't stop me from returning for more of this amazing food.",6,0,2

I believe Porter Airlines is the only airline servicing Billy Bush Billy Bob, but that's fine. The flight attendants wear old school uniforms and they serve complimentary wine and beer on the flights. Speaking of complimentary snacks, those are available in the gate area of the airport for all passengers. Yes, free bottled water, soft drinks, and snacks for all! You can buy more substantial items, including bottled beer and wine, from a nearby cashier.

The airport itself is small and easy to navigate, and offers a lovely view of Toronto. We walked through the new tunnel connecting the airport to the mainland and found it a quick and easy way to go. Customs was also a breeze.

For the convenience a small airport like Billy Bush Billy Bob offers, there are also drawbacks: When flights are delayed, as they were for us, seating quickly becomes limited, and the lack of additional food options becomes an issue.

Overall, though, Billy Bush Billy Bob is the way to go when flying to Toronto. It will always be my first choice.",4,5,4

The only thing that was going for the suite rooms was that you get Bath and Body Works condiments.  If you ask for more then you get the same stuff everyone gets.  I have to say that the walls are super thin too.  We got a really good deal for the weekend, lie $200 a night.  You would THINK that it would be a decent room but it was pure crap.  If it wasn't for a friend who annoyingly whined that she had to stay somewhere nicer with a pool then we wouldn't have bothered to come here.  I just came a week prior and I rather pay 1\/5th of the price to stay in a crappy motel.  It's about the same in my opinion! At least the walls there weren't as thin as here!

I've never met a French fry I didn't love, but how refreshing to have some really good quality and different sides.  Personally, I recommend the Broccoli Salad.  Although I was unable to enjoy the delicacies of a liquid variety ..... this visit ..... I will surely return to try out a few of the great beers they have and a few of the numerous top shelf bourbons I spied behind the bar.  Benjamin's deserves every star .... and then some ....",2,0,0

We've been here a few times because of how close it is to home and each time there is something that just isn't quite right. The most recent time, which is why I'm writing this review, our food took over one hour to come. We repeatedly flagged down our waitress and she kept insisting that she was ""checking on it"" when finally the huz had it and we were about to let the manager have it and then walk out when the manager walked over and apologized for our order never being put in. They took care of the bill but still, left a really poor impression of terrible incompetence. Our waitress never apologized and acted as though nothing happened when she came back to see how everything was. Extremely disappointed with the service.

The rep had told the doctor that this new method was FDA approved and covered by insurance and non-invasive.  Sounded pretty good to me except that insurance did not cover it.  I was asked by a customer service rep in March of 2016 to work in their behalf communicating that their product was not experimental and was told not to worry that they could help with a billing adjustment worse case - but again not to worry as insurance should cover.  This last week I received a letter that insurance UMR again denied procedure as experimental.  I called customer service and spoke with Alicia who said there really was no adjustment that could be made other than an appeal for a write off.  In the meantime I also had to have a CT scan for another issue and that showed that I had polyp's in my colon so now will have to go thru the hose procedure anyway.  SO - IT MAY NOT WORK, MAY COST YOU A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF POCKET AND YOU MAY HAVE TO GET A COLONOSCOPY regardless - gave 2 stars instead of 1 for customer service being nice and the poop in a box being non invasive.

The person at the counter taking the order was spaced out and we had to repeat our order several times. While waiting to pick up our food, the person behind the counter forgot our coffee was to be iced and asked twice. Not that big of a deal, but we were the only ones in line. 

While watching the food being made, we noticed two things: first, the shop was short on bread. One would think that a restaurant that only served bahn mis would have enough bread. Second, the meat was microwaved before being placed on the bread. Microwaved.

Finally, the sandwich. We ordered the roasted pork and roasted chicken. You could not tell the sandwiches apart. Instead of having nice slices of meat, the meat was chopped up into pieces - like match stick slices of meat. There was more bread than meat, and more pickled vegetables than meat, so that was disappointing.

Hopefully our next experience will be better, if we come again. But, for a $7 sandwich, you can get more meat at subway. We've had better bahn mis at the place in Squirrel Hill.",0,0,0

We have stayed at places all over the world.  Here is a brief on what happened in Las Vegas this month, Oct, 2016

We checked in, early afternoon, and where heading to our room when we were accosted by a rep asking how our check in went.  We have been in the place less than 15 minutes and she wants to survey us?  We had flown for 6 hours getting up early that day and just wanted to relax in our room.  Can you leave me a lone?

Over the years each time we sign in, every location want us to go to a presentation.  Normally I say no and that is that.  Vegas apparently has different rules.,. They continue to call until you attend or I complain loud enough. Why, what is so important in those presentations that we should take 45 minutes to 3 hours of our vacation time to get a pitch on upgrading our account. Each tine that's exactly what it's about, buying more.

We are happy with the level we have.  How do we get that message to the senior management of this location and all the others?  

There are other options nearer to the strip if you want to stay with Wordmark.   I'd highly recommend that you book to stay in one of those or move your existing reservations.   

One other item.  Right around 9 PM on Sun and Mon the fire alarm went off for about 20 minutes.  No announcements or explanation on what to do.  Common sense told my wife and I head to the parking lot away from the building, No one else was out there.  Finally it was turned off 10 minutes later but still no explanation or announcements.  How will guests react when its a real fire?  They won't because it must be just a test.

This is the worst place we have stayed.  Not because of the look or feel of the room but the staff which is the key element in any business  Front line employees need to be trained on how to approach tired travelers but at least let then get to their room.,Tthe type of questions they CAN or SHOULD  ask and to back away and let guests settle in.  I personally don't want to tell my life history to a stranger just check me please.

This is the Last time we will stay at this location.  If they can make some major improvements on the items I have mentioned, I'd consider coming back but would want to speak with management prior to booking.  This type improvement takes a long time and doesn't happen over night.

I hope this helps some but more importantly the Worldmark sees and takes action.",7,2,0

First of all they outsourced the movers because the truck that showed up was not from Blue Star Van Lines. We received the quote via email and phoned twice to confirm the quote and ask questions since we have all heard the horror stories of moving companies holding your goods hostage until you come up with more money. We were quoted $70\/hr for 2 men, 2 hours travelling time at $140 and it would take approx 3 hours for the move so $350 plus tax total. We assumed they woud go over by 1 hour so add another $70 pus tax, Wrong...we were charged $770 plus $100 tax for $870. We complained that the guys took 1 more hour than us to arrive at our destination, they stopped for lunch, and that we werent paying for their lunch break so they subtracted $70. I will never used these guys or anyone who doesn't quote a flat rate again. We learned the hard way that you get charged from arrival time to unloading time at final destination and if it takes 6 hours to get there due to weather or  traffic you get charged that in their working costs so movers who actually load for 2 1\/2 hours and unload for 3 1\/2 for a total of 6 hours don't actually get paid for only those hours, they get paid, in this case for 9 hours plus the 2 hours travel time.

I'm not your regular tourist and i don't go for the over priced hotels like the Wynn or the Venetian. Most of the time I stay at The Orleans. Those of you familiar with The Orleans know it is not pretentious, but has some great amenities that are free or affordable. 

This time I planned a last minute trip and The Orleans was sold out. So Expedia had a great rate for The Hilton or LVH as they are now calling themselves. I got 2 nights (weekdays) for $150 including the resort fee. I hate resort fees. But anyway....

I checked in on a Monday night. Check in way easy and so was finding my room. Unfortunately when I got to my room there were several problems: a broken phone, a clogged sink, and a non working safe. And I have to add it was a very odd looking room with a good deal of unused space. 

I called down to the operator (there is no front desk) button. I was bounced around from the operator to the front desk a few times as no one at the front desk was picking up. Once someone did pick up I was put on hold for quite some time. Finally when someone answered they told me to come down to the front desk and they would switch my room. 

The switch was done easily and the room was nicer in general (east tower).  But the safe in my new room didn't work either. I called down to the front desk and they asked me if they should send someone up. Stupid question and of course I said yes. 

It took about 30?minutes but 2 polite maintenance workers came up. They fixed it easily. It seems as the previous occupant was a comedian and decided to lock a water bottle in the safe before he left. That was he end of the night. 

Today I strayed off by looking for the buffet. Although the hotel book in my room said it was open for breakfast it wAs not. So I left the hotel and went about my day. 

When I returned I laid out at their pool. The pool area is really nice and I consider it the highlight of the hotel. I will try to enjoy this again in the morning before I head back to LA. Now the day is over and I tried to get some water from the vending machine. I had to go to 3 different floors until I found one that worked.

He couldn't answer any of my questions and danced around everything. I asked what would you do if it rained on my wedding day and he responded with it wont. Well I'm glad he thinks he can predict the weather and I had to ask him 3 times before he finally told me what they would do with responding that it wont. I walked out so upset and I wont be holding my wedding there.",2,6,0

Room was nice with a large soaking tub and separate shower and remote curtains which opened up to a nice view of ""lake Bellagio"" out front.  We really had a chance to test the quiet factor of the room, seeing as how the streets were literally packed to capacity with people on New Years Eve and we found that no matter how many people were outside screaming, the room was very quiet.  Room service was slow, even in the middle of the night but in the B's defense the entire Vegas strip is an over crowded madhouse this time of year.  My only complaint was a situation with a rude room service attendant, which was promptly resolved upon notifying a manager.  Other than the rude employee, this place offers excellent rooms (and views if your are lucky enough to get a strip facing room) which are a nice quiet escape from the madness of the surrounding Las Vegas strip.  One last observation, we noticed every time we visited another casino (Mandalay, Venetian, Pallazo) the valet was always full and we had to self-park.  This was never the case with the Bellagio, and it seemed just as packed as any other casino on the strip.  I would also say the Bellagio has one of the nicest lobbies challenged only by maybe the Wynn or the Venetian.  Granted the Bellagion isnt the cheapest place to stay, it is certainly one of the nicer places to stay.",0,0,0

I called in the morning to make an appointment for a full set and a pedi for 1PM. When I arrived I wasn't greeted and there were people at all of the stations including two waiting. The salon was a little dirty and run down so I had a gut feeling to leave but I didn't. I told them i called earlier and had a 1 o'clock appointment and they frantically looked at the clock. After they confirmed it was 1PM they had me sit at a pedicure and wait for the pedi lady to finish the pedi she was almost finished with. Pedi was fine, I would recommend you go for a pedi only. So I told the main lady that I would need to come back at a later time for my full set because I was on a time crunch. She insisted on me getting my nails done and started my nails while the lady was finishing my toes. She speeds through my nails, cuts me, speeds through the gel polish, puts THREE layers of gel color on me and TWO top coats. If you get your nails done often, we all know that is not right. So then right before my nails are finished she bounces to another girl to fix her nails because she messed those ones up too.

The meat is real 100% beef but the best burgers are not made with 100% beef, it's usually a mix of lamb and\/or pork in addition to beef, but since it is a store that is halal (no pork), it is understandable why they do not have pork mixed into their chuck.

It was a bit grainy and dry but that's the taste of real beef. I cannot say I LOVED it but it was a good burger and quite filling. The other parts of it like the tomato, lettuce, bun.. it was all ""meh"" for me.

1. You wait for an ungodly amount of time in the waiting room, but that's to be expected. 
2. When you get assigned to an exam room, you can hear the staff loudly engage in unprofessional conversations about a wide variety of topics ranging from their weekend exploits to the patients that ARE IN THE EXAM ROOMS. The walls are paper thin.
3. No matter who you end up seeing, a doctor, PA, whoever... here's what will happen. They will do a cursory exam and then tell you they can't provide the services so you need to go to the ER. They will not do a damn thing. 

Last night I went in because I've had a fever between 102-107 for the last week. I'm also diabetic. The doctor, who was super condescending and hostile, said he couldn't do anything and I needed to go to the ER because my blood sugar was elevated. Like, no kidding, I'm diabetic, I know my blood sugar is elevated. He said the fever was not related to the blood sugar elevation (Duh) but he still refused to treat the fever. 

He refused to treat my fever and said in a super nasty way, ""I guess they'll have to treat that at the ER."" Then he gave me some paperwork to take to the ER. 

Perhaps they are getting some kind of kickback from the various ERs? Also, they must have some corporate rule or business plan where they never actually provide any health care services, but merely funnel patients to the local ERs. 

The doctor told my husband that I could die because my blood sugar was high. I'm home now 12 hours later, blood sugar is back to normal, but I still have this damn fever.

Came here for breakfast and dinner (2 nights) while staying at the Grand. Service was fast and friendly, and the food was pretty good.

Breakfast:
I got the crepe with chocolate and strawberry, which was just chocolate syrup and strawberry jelly (or jam). It was ok. I've definitely had better crepes. Hearty ones with real fruit and nutella, but this was just syrup. And the crepe itself wasn't great.

Also had the breakfast burrito. They were out of sausage, so we got ham, egg and cheese. It was good. Didn't blow my mind... I've had better, but not bad.

Dinner:
One night, I got the tacos. I chose 1 chicken and 2 latin smoked brisket. Really good!. The latin smoked brisket was especially yum. I got this with the Mexican rice (you get 2 sides with the taco plate). I didn't care for it. My husband got the bacon burger, which I tried, and it was good. He liked it too.

For dinner on our second night I got a turkey burger, which I enjoyed. Also got the onion rings, which I wasn't crazy about. Too big and the onion just fell right out when you'd take a bite.

The place itself is cool. I love the set-up and decor. I do agree with other reviewers that it was a bit confusing as to where to order. I would definitely come again, to try other things on the menu. And if anything, I know the latin smoked brisket tacos will satisfy me.",0,0,0

aQUcfxW5ONc_BkqmRQ4feA,YHr-ijGyWQg3hsP-sEEl4A,HI56ArpYEbhEUeRx9Curpw,3,2013-07-09,"Asian Cafe Express shares the same Chinese name as the Cafe de Coral in Hong Kong, and boasts itself as ""Arizona's 1st Hong Kong style cafe serving authentic Chinese, Southeast Asia & Western influenced dishes"". Over 300 dishes are found on the menu, ranging from the classic Hong Kong style baked pork chop rice to the Americanized sweet and sour pork. Even Hawaiian roast pork appears on the menu. Despite offering a wide selection of Chinese dishes, Asian Cafe Express lacks the ""outstanding factor"" since it is a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" restaurant. This type of restaurant serves nearly everything in an ordinary fashion and neglects to specialize in any particular dish.

I came to Asian Cafe Express for a weekday lunch and the restaurant was packed. Most of the guests were eating ACE's $3.98 special bowl, a one-item Americanized rice bowl (kung pao chicken, teriyaki chicken, sweet and sour pork, etc.). I summoned the Cantonese waiter and ordered a baked pork chop rice. He told me I would have to wait 45 minutes to 1 hour for this dish. LOL, who has that long to eat lunch? In nearly all HK cafes that I have been to, only 10 to 15 minutes is required to deliver this dish to my table even when the kitchen is busy. All the ingredients are generally pre-processed such that the rice just needs to be stir-fried and the ingredients just needs to be baked to melt the cheese before the baked pork chop rice is served. Unfortunately, this preparation is absent at ACE, likely due to its low demand. A 60 minute estimate suggests that the pork chops had not been cut and fried, the vegetables have not been diced, and\/or the rice has not been stir-fried or cooked. Basically the dish is cooked from scratch. 

Alternatively, I ordered the Fresh Tomatoes with Two Eggs and Beef since it was guaranteed to be out instantly. It arrived in 20 minutes. This rice plate is considered as a basic and classic HK over-rice dish. It was acceptable, the egg was fried crispy on the corners yet not burnt, an attribute that even some HK cafes in Southern California neglect. The tomatoes gravy was not as salty as I expected and beef were tender and cooked properly. However, my biggest concern was the rice that was used. The rice texture was poor. It resembled a very loose rice pilaf rather than Jasmine rice. Rice pilaf is highly uncharacteristic of what is served at a traditional Hong Kong style cafe.

To complement the rice dish, I also ordered the daily soup - a carrot and Chinese vegetable soup. It was probably the best Cantonese old-fire soup available in Arizona. Unfortunately, the soup was very oily and contained a lot of MSG. It definitely does not pass the home-style quality test.

Finally, I ordered the HK style coffee with milk tea (yin-yeung), to complete the HK-cafe experience. The young waiter informed me that it would take over 30 minutes to prepare, because he had to boil the water and then steep the tea. I received the drink in a soup cup (LOL). I could tell that milk tea and hot beverages are not ordered often enough for the restaurant to order mugs. The yin yeung was prepared with the HK-style procedure, mixing coffee and milk tea in equal proportions, but the milk tea was prepared in an odd way (red tea was mixed with a dash of 2% milk). Overall, the taste was acceptable for Arizona standards. At least better than some places in LA, which give you 75% coffee, 25% English tea, and condensed milk. 

Asian Cafe Express offers authentic Cantonese dishes on their menu but I think some of the proper ingredients are lacking in Arizona, so the dishes cannot be prepared with the same standard as those found in Hong Kong or even Los Angeles. In Arizona, ACE is considered one of the best HK-style restaurants, but in LA, the restaurant would not survive for more than 6 months.",8,4,4

Won't lie, after seeing some videos on it I was a bit nervous as I'm afraid of heights.  But it was actually OK and nothing scary.  Like some people have mentioned, it is like being In a ski lift.  In fact because there is no drop, it is just a straight zip over.  It actually seem to be over in less than a 30 seconds.  We did it during the day but sure it is cooler at night.
I'm not sure what the regular cost is, but we found some deals on Groupon which included free entry to the rooftop bar later at night.  So the cost was $38 for two people and with bar entry was worth it.

Wrong! We locked up our bikes and went in.

This was the first long weekend since the flooding that the islands were fully open, with beautiful weather and an opportunity to make up for the dire lack of business. But, they still prefer to turn people away because they can't be bothered to service all their tables and the customers should know better, you should have booked earlier and said you'd come back.

I'd rather go to establishments where the customers are the reason they're in business, not the other way around. Keep your snot. Won't bother grovelling for another opportunity to come back.",0,2,0

Long short, Sands over charged for labor, I needed a Master Air Flow sensor...something that shouldn't take long or be charged $230.00 to be installed. And that's just the price for the labor, not including the price for the part. When I question about it, I got the run around. My car was already there and worked on, so for me to get it back, had to pay. I called today (Monday) for a manager, and get the run around...told he will call back...never did. And the man who answered the phone said labor is $120 an hour. I said even for something that takes less than 15 mins to install, he just got off the phone quickly. Anyway, I will never go back and will never refer anyone to them. Money suckers and didn't care about doing right by me. I learned a lesson.

So I write this not in angst, but in a true hope that they can fix their issues and become a great restaurant one day.

Decor.. blah blah blah it's nice, don't care about that.. 

Service was good, although the timing coming out of the kitchen needs A LOT of work.  I understand, I've worked the restaurant world, but this place didn't open last week, and while a slight delay is acceptable, a 10 minute difference between first and last entrees shows nothing less than a lack of communication and proper planning...

..this would only be acceptable if... 

...management or someone is to explain.. something.. lie to me.. I don't care, but at least approach the table and apologize.  Or make a conscious effort to assist (I watched what I assume to be a FOH manager walking around all night, we weren't hard to spot, we were the big 10 top in the middle of the restaurant, 5 of us had whole plates of food in front of us the others simply had plate-envy on their faces).  I do want to stress that the server, the trainee, and any assistants were excellent at what they did, management dropped the ball on this one, big time...

Food was good but.. (there has to be a but)  my wife didn't get what she ordered, they attempted to pass a steak off as a prime rib as if I was born yesterday and don't know what prime rib is... furthermore people will tolerate a bit more rareness in a prime rib than they may usually prefer in a grilled cut, so maybe, just maybe, you should communicate this to your customer and allow them to make another selection...  I know my wife, and she would not have selected what was brought.  I had the duck breast, and it was phenomenal, mid-rare, not too fat-chewy like mid-rare duck can be sometimes, truly delicious dinner.  

The wine selection is great, they also have a nice list of beers and a full bar, so aces there.

They have a creative selection of appetizers and we all ordered different ones and swapped plates a bit (I know.. naughty) the charcuterie of mainly spanish meat and pickled veggies is delicious as were the scallops (but seriously.. 2 mid-sized scallops for $8???).

All in all I'd say try it, maybe you'll get what you order, maybe you wont, we had fun but our group could have had fun Fuel pizza that night, for me to spend nearly $200 for dinner and drinks for 2, I can do much better in the QC.  

My recommendation, spend half as much, get more consistent French-Mediterranean food at Roosters in South Park, but as I stated earlier, I hope this place succeeds because good food is good for all people.  Best of luck.",0,0,0

Built by the great Steve (Weinberg) Wynn himself, boasted to be the best and most luxurious hotel ever conceived in Vegas, the Wynn was a bit of a bust. 

I say this with a bit of great disappointment. After all, who would have ever expected this from the man who built the likes of the great Mirage, and the now forever famous mega-resort: The Bellagio? 

And, what is ""this"" I speak of? 

Well dears, it is being bamboozled and thrown around like minor class citizens.  Here is the story and the lowdown on what happened in this incident: 

Time: Two weeks before Valentine's Day\/President's Day Weekend
Place: Wynn Hotel, Las Vegas, NV

As any Yelper in an economic downturn would do, I hopped online to find the best bang for my buck in Vegas. I booked via Hotwire and found a great deal for a five star resort which turned out to be the Wynn - SWEET! -- or so I thought! Two weeks before one of the busiest weekends in Vegas, we received confirmation that the Wynn had been OVERBOOKED, and we were AUTOMATICALLY transferred from the Wynn to the TRUMP HOTEL. 

EW. 

Now, you ask, what's so wrong with the TRUMP HOTEL? Well, exactly that. We had been ""trumped"". Not only did the Trump Hotel NOT have a CASINO (I know, reallly!?), it was OFF STRIP and far as HELL if one were to walk to the strip. We begrudgingly accepted due to the fact it was only about two weeks before the trip and we didn't want to risk not having a place to stay. 

One week before the trip, we received word from the Wynn inviting us back. As it were, the ONLY reason we even got ""invited"" back was because a huge Wells Fargo party for that weekend had gotten CANCELLED. 

This leads me to believe one, and only one thing, which was the Wynn had sold its open rooms to Hotwire and got them filled.  They then received word from Wells Fargo for that huge executives party, and kicked out the Hotwire-ers, and then when the party got cancelled, asked us to go back. BAIT AND SWITCH, BAMBOOZLED. 

I will tell you loud and clear, I went to the Wynn, but not before I made them pay with comp'ed nights and lunches, but spent my entertainment dollars elsewhere.

Not only that, upon arrival, it took them 1.5 hours to check us in. ONE POINT FIVE HOURS. That is just ridiculous and stupid. In addition, the POOL was NOT OPEN, and if we wanted to use the pool we had to WALK to Encore. Steve Wynn: if you can't afford to staff your hotel, then do us all a favor and FOLD your operations while you can save yourself some face. 

To be fair, the views were great. The rooms were clean and spacious, and housekeeping was very nice.In general the grounds were kept well, but really not what i expected from a boasted FIVE STAR hotel. I kept thinking to myself I should have gone to the Bellagio. 

Overall, I think this hotel is OVERHYPED. Sure, its nice, and elegant, but it just is not all that great. The service was friendly, but I really don't like the way the hotel is run to seemingly treat normal people as space fillers. All in all, it was a good experience at the end, but what happened in the beginning will probably never let me stay at the Wynn again. 

Unfortunate.",10,4,3

Prices are ridiculous, but so is everything in Vegas. O_o

TzRLKa-0pVLy2yywQSCiOg,VHlDoYYJmXf7gzv9poLmZw,Wcuo6YmYj3xhCso5sMQcOw,3,2017-09-15,"The new 'go-to' pizza place, Blaze Pizza has such great potential. After all the pizza is fabulous and consistent. And since you can have them build it your way you should get what you want each time. This is what I come back for, a pizza that is tasty, with a crust that is crunchy and chewy at the same time. 

The other key components of a good restaurant are service and image. It is in these areas that Blaze sometimes falls flat. 

Their service is usually not terrible but is often loose and inefficient, lackadaisical at best. Their robotic employees seem to just go through the motions most of the time, seeming bored and uninterested in the task at hand. They rarely smile or even look at a customer in front of them. Their main focus always seems to be on how quickly they can get you to no longer stand in front of them. I should point out that there are usually a couple of top notch employees on duty, those who smile and are efficient in what they do, in other words the ones who do actually give a hoot about their job. 

Now about the image. The restaurant itself is kept up well and normally meets most customers' expectations. The employees' appearance is quite another story. Blaze seems to pride itself on hiring people who dress like they are still learning that task, with pants hanging below the waist, hats on backwards, plastic beads hanging from necks and arms. Not a big deal right? When you add in all of the tattoos, nose rings, ear discs and other face jewelry it just gives a trashy look to an otherwise beautiful restaurant. At one point the most heavily tattooed female was standing on the food line showing each of her tats to a coworker. 

These issues could be easily fixed by simply having a responsible adult in charge at all times and being a bit more selective in the hiring process.",0,0,0

Every time I was here though, I felt that the waitress would look down on me as if I was a 5 year old child and it wouldn't matter what I would say or want from her, she would simply ignore it. After these repetitious experiences, I stopped visiting until one day my family was moving. My poor father, sister, and boyfriend had worked up a sweat all day long without water in the desert heat and decided to come to Honey Pig since it was the closest Korean restaurant.

When we walked in, the place was busy but not packed. We were asked to pick a seat and was given the menu and iced water to start-- hallelujah. We finished the pitcher of water faster than you can say Mississippi and asked for another pitcher of water. The waitress eagerly answered yes but did not budge from where she was standing. She continued her conversation with a fellow waitress and I kept giving her an evil glare, hoping that she'll feel my radiating energy but she didn't. When she finally moved to take our orders, I asked for water again and without apologies, asked her coworker to grab another pitcher for us. 

After waiting a good while for our food, it finally arrived. The bulgogi was a little dry and too sweet. Even though we had been moving all day and thus starving, we were hesitant to finish the meal. At one point, my dad asked for some more lettuce and jalapenos and, no kidding, had to ask 4 times before someone even pretended to listen to our needs. I ordered the naengmyun and I must say it's one of the worst I've ever tasted and let me just tell you, I'm a naengmyun fanatic and have had my fair share of good and bad noodles. It was simply salty and nothing more to it. I must have taken three bites before I put my chopsticks down and refused to eat any more.

I've held a ""tip-dependent"" job since my freshman year in high school and I'd like to think that I know what good service is. Unless I am highly dissatisfied, I tip at least 15% wherever I go. However, at the end of our meal I told my dad that he should only leave a $2 tip because of the less than desirable food and even more horrible service. 

I guess if I was starving for a week without water, I'd rate the food as decent but simply for service, I would never come back. I don't know how I even entertained the idea of coming back here after such a horrible experience but I know now, never again.",2,2,0

My car payment was finally due a month ago they told me it would automatically come out of my checking account for the first 16 months I got an extended warranty as well which is supposed to be tied into my loan.

I get a call from the credit union saying that they haven't received my payment well what the hell came out on the 15th of November!!! They lied to me and expect me to pay my car payment and the warranty when she clearly said it would be tied in with my payment. I'm down here now to know what they're going to do to fix it because I WANT IT REFUNDED AND NOW I WANT IT CANCELLED BECAUSE THEY BLATANTLY LIED.

My stepfather was a liquor salesman and one of his accounts was this building, he had the business in that place before it was Malnati's too. So I remember Lou from the first month he was open and I was a kid in 8th grade. Nuff said.

I love their pizzas. Everytime I go to Chicago we ALWAYS get Malnati delivery. 

They have carry-out frozen pizzas (10""); sausage, cheese, pepperoni and two others for sale right inside the front door on the left in a tall freezer case, just grab what you want and pay for them right at the counter just inside from the front door, doesn't get much easier than that.

These frozen pizzas are simple to cook: preheat the oven to 425, remove the cardboard top from the frozen pizza pan, remove the frozen pizza, wipe the pan dry and spray the inside with any kind of lite oil, replace and stick it in the oven for 40 minutes.

Remove the pizza, use a scissors to make several vertical cuts in the side of the aluminum baking pan so you can slide the pizza out onto your own pizza pan for slicing.

This is without a doubt the best frozen pizza in this country. I buy them three at a time, it costs me about $45 for three to carry out. I have a styrofoam box I carry them home in since I live like 35 miles from this place.

It's in the strip mall at the north-east corner of Camelback at Central, way back in the corner of the mall. Look for the ice cream place next door. The place is hard to see from the parking lot, but it's there. The mall is right across the street from a tall bronze and black colored office building about ten stories tall, let that be your landmark to watch for. Turn into the mall at the traffic light on Cameback at 1st Street. 

My only complaint about this place is the employees can be lacking in motivation sometimes. If I could I would give Malnati's in Phoenix 4.5 stars.",2,0,0

He asked me 4 times if I wanted spring rolls and every time I said yes, he then ignored me and pushed me back to the lady who magically reappeared. She then asked me if wanted spring rolls again. Then at check out she asked if I wanted a drink I said medium. She ignored me and ran my card, never gave me a drink and walked off. I flagged her down and had to run my card AGAIN for a drink.

As soon as we get there they say they're going through renovations and so they don't have locker rooms or even a place to put your things. So you leave your shoes in the employees closet. Then the massage therapists arrive. I had specifically asked for a woman when I purchased the package a month prior. They had scheduled me a man. The switch took 15 min out of OUR TIME!!! They brought me to a room where the paint was chipping, the heaters were very noisy and when the noise from the heaters stopped you could hear the honking-truck-heavy Sherbrooke street traffic. I had to undress in this room with no place to put my clothes but a hook behind the door.The heated rock massage was ok at best. I've had this type of massage in Vancouver, Toronto, Québec city, New York, etc. It's my favorite massage, and this was the most basic one,with the least amount of stones and bla bla bla. 

After this unrelaxing massage, i had to get dressed again to wait for my facial. Water was offered in an old mug. They brought me to a room that had no window this time. Traffic and heater noise was the same. Had to get undressed AGAIN. Facial was ok. Got dressed again. Was brought to a chair with a view while I waited for my fiancée. I waited a long time.

When I went to ask them when my fiancée would be done, I came to th ed front desk to see her arguing with them about payment. They were saying we hadn't payed everything in advance. Which we did. Anyway I came out of there without the usual sigh of relaxation that usually happens when leaving. I actually felt a ripped off.

I remember working in the Sears Tower when we first heard that Chili's (Brinker Intl') had bought the rights to the concept. In short, we were all bummed and felt they would goof it up. 

Well so much for our misgiving's, they sold off Macaroni Grill and made a decent attempt at allowing a little bit of Chicago's Italian scene to come alive for the rest of the country. 

Now don't get me wrong, this restaurant isn't perfect, as they were this past Friday evening. Yes, the Hostess station still seems confused as Laura M noted in her review last year. But where can you get a good meal for two, including appetizers, drinks and dessert, along with two especially prepared take home entrees for $55?  Really!

So we started with a glass of Merlot ($8.00), Soup ($3.95)and a Sausage appetizer ($8.50 which was a meal in itself, see photos).  For out entrees, we had their Classic Pasta for $12.95 and Mama's Lasagna $14.95.  Both were very good, though the entrees came first and our server's boss was indifferent at best while being distracted with a larger party.  Our server Hannah was outstanding, but so much for our easy going, pre-Christmas romantic meal.

For dessert, we shared two of their petite samplers for $3.50 each and coffee.  Their Apple Cobbler and dark chocolate Truffle balls were delicious and worth the trip.  We highly recommend them.  The regular sized dessert are good, but way over the top in size.

The bill came to $66.16, less a $10.00 off coupon from their email list.  So if we stopped here, it would be a fair $55.37 and not a bad deal, right?  But Maggiano's was still offering their buy two, take two home special. Nice! So we had enough for a second dinner sometime this week.  All and all, a delicious option.

So just to be clear this is not a wine bar, you cannot just show up and drink glasses of wine, it's a store that has special tastings twice a week. During the special tasting you can try 5 wines that are being showcased for $12. There is an option to upgrade to 7 total samples for $20; the 2 extra tastings are from higher priced wines. I would say that the pours are satisfying and my guess would be 4oz each? You can also nibble on cheese and crackers with your tasting. If you go to their website you can sign up for their weekly newsletter which tells you what wines will be featured in the tastings for that week. 

The Little Birdie Wine Nest also offers fun events throughout the month for you to enjoy! Examples would be paint nights, greeting signs that you make out of paper flowers, decorating wine bottles, and crafts using wine works to make things like initials. (And I verified that these are the legit wine corks made out of cork with a wine stain on one end, not the synthetic ones). At each event you get 3 wine samples and prices range from $25-$45 that I saw. I do not think these are bad prices at all for 2 hours of hands on crafting with drinks and a fun unique experience with friends. 

The store also obviously sells wine, I picked up a bottle of Cocoa di Vine (chocolate wine). I also grabbed some handmade Cleveland, Ohio wooden coasters from their tiny array of Ohio themed goods. I did see other things for sell like jewelry, shirts, cutting boards, bags with cute little sayings; typical boutique like stuff from various vendors.

Lastly I cannot forget Robin, the owner! She was very personable, patient with our group of four talkative ladies, and accommodating by letting me have moscato only for my tastings since I disliked the dry wines on tap for tasting the night we went. 

We all had an enjoyable time sipping wine and chatting for a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend you check this place out! (Weds of Fri for the tastings!)",4,1,2

#1. remember i said the bathrooms looked wonderful, that is till you get into the stall and there is rude graffiti carved in the door. so you have your pick of penis pics, swastikas, racist comments, and one ""have a wonderful day"" carved into the door. i know graffiti is not the places fault but its obvious they are doing nothing to stop or cover it up. can you say replace the door. 

#2. the first person to our table brought complimentary miso soup. that's it no drink order or hey your server will be right with you. he just set the soup down and walked away. 

#3the server finally came by and asked for our drink order but we did not get our drinks till after we had our first order of rolls on the table and it was only after i asked if i could get my drink. 

#4 when the waitress took our order my friend asked for a fork(he dint use chopsticks) well he got it after asking three different people and asking a total of 4 times. 

#5 when the people who deliver the rolls set them down they don't say what they are or anything. then when we asked what they were she had to take out a menu and find it saying"" she thinks this is "" and ""I'm not sure what that is"" should you not know what the hell your serving? 

#6 as we went they kept bringing out roll after roll but not taking the old plates away, at a time we had 12 dirty dishes stacked at the end of our table 
. 
are you keeping track? that's 6 bad things and i haven't even gotten to the food quality. 

#7 the rolls on a whole were bland and flavorless.it was like they all were California rolls topped with different things. we kept ordering rolls to try and find one that was good but none. 

#8 the fish freshness was not up to par. there were a few times i wanted to spit it out. i have had some very fresh fish and fish you can tell right away if it is or is not. and theirs is not. 

#9 the orders were wrong. and when pointed out the server just said "" that's yours"" and walked away. 

i believe I'm stopping at 9. if i could i would give them a half a star not a full star. it was the worst service and quality i have ever had. the worst part of this place was 2 hours later when i got sick. 
over all..........dont i repeat DON'T go. that is unless you like crappy food and even crappier service.

When are beers were almost gone...our burgers, as well as the guys' beside us burgers arrived.    Huh?!   Do they have to wait til they have orders for multiple burgers before they start cooking?

-Baked ricotta (MY FAV!)
-Pepperoni flatbread

Lesson learned.

The salad selection here is all meat, all the time. I guess people in Arizona can't even eat a salad without meat on it? Maybe I'm just being judgmental. Possibly I'm trying to get a rise out of my AZ-filiates with this inflammatory post. But honestly, the rest of the food in Sky Harbor Purgatory is pretty abysmal and mostly meat\/cheese\/bread-based, and even this last-hope outposts of salads doesn't offer anything truly healthy. The chicken is of suspicious quality and Allah himself only knows when it was actually cooked. Gristly bits are rife. The lettuce is dried out but not wilted (how does that happen?!) and the dressings are all cream-based. 

Can't I just get some greens... maybe some fiber and roughage? Something fresh and\/or healthy? At least one of those two? Pretty please with dates on top?

It cost me about $9 for a boxed, pre-pre-pre-made salad and it was an unsatisfying salad at that. The surly attitude of the counterperson may have been the best part of the whole experience.

Our orders were taken fairly promptly upon sitting down (outdoors on the patio; there was a 30 minute wait on a Saturday night for indoor seating at approximately 5:30 pm, prime before-movie time), there was minimal wait for our food, our plates cleared and check presented in timely fashion.

Humus appetizer has always been a sure bet for us - perfect light dish for these hot AZ summer months. Their salads are also consistently fresh with the grilled chicken done to perfection; tender and not dried out. Prices are reasonable for the selections and portions. 

The staff seems to do a good job of keeping the waiting crowd moving as empty tables are cleaned quickly and they're accommodating to hasty requests - I saw the hostess last night agree to move two tables together without hesitation for a large party upon request. 

On a side note, I got a chuckle out of the tee shirt one of the hostesses was wearing - emblazoned with the phrase ""MEOW"", perhaps a reference to another establishment at the same strip mall that has gathered some notable press of late and which did not seem to be attracting any of the overflow of patrons who were patiently waiting for tables at Pita Jungle when we left.

Maybe we got the wrong stuff but....The Baja taco sucks. Dry, no flavor, and obviously we made a huge mistake getting it. The chicken taco was much better and had flavor as well as the queso fundido. However be aware,you would think a place that charges you $10 for a cheese dip would give you at least two orders of tortilla rolls,but they don't, they give you enough for half, then they secretly charge you a $1 when you ask for more.....it's the principle.  We were so disappointed by the exceptional hype the city of Pittsburgh has poured in this place that the mood was set after the flavorless Baja taco. 
The el Diablo did not taste like anything special either except that it was a normal margarita that costs $10. I would have rather dumped $70 on mad mex which has more reliable food am that is worth the money.......Or wish that Yo!Rita was still open......or Verde........or I lived closer to Taco Bell.

about ten minutes later, that same clerk from before emerged from the back to stand behind the service desk and take no notice of me standing in line just a short distance away. he did however seem to notice a woman who was standing at the complete opposite end of the cashier counter, where there wasn't even an open register, and offer to help her. at this point, i had been in the store waiting to be rung up for my one item for about 30 minutes. fed up with the frustrating experience, i put the jug of coolant on the counter that i had planned to buy, and went to the gas station across the street and purchased the same item and had to wait only a few minutes.

Completely disappointed with our first visit.  The 2 stars is, as Yelp states ""Meh.  I've experienced better.""  That pretty much sums up our feeling about what we tasted.  We didn't hate it nor were we completely grossed out by the food, it just left us entirely unimpressed.  As my husband said ""There is nothing distinct about any of the flavors, it just isn't exciting.""  We had no complaints about the service and we certainly wish them well, as we prefer to support local businesses, but we hope the food quality will improve.

We called in takeout for one order of egg rolls, one Pad Kee Moa (Drunken Noodles) with beef, medium spicy and one Kaeng Peg (Red Curry) with chicken, medium spicy.   The gal who took the phone order was very friendly, as were the counter staff when we picked up.

Arriving home, we were anxious to dig in.  The egg rolls may have suffered slightly from sitting in styrofoam for the 15 minute drive back home.  The wrappers seemed a bit greasy.  The pork filling, although tasty, was almost too densely packed, it was more like a giant pork meatball encased in the wonton.

When I used to work in Tempe, one of our regular lunch choices was either Thai Basil or Thai Elephant (University locations).  Thai Elephant in particular, is the standard to which I judge all red curry here in AZ. As my old carpool friend used to say ""I could drink the red curry sauce.""  In comparison, I found Thai Gourmet's much thinner and lacking the pronounced coconut milk flavor I've come to crave.  There were also some grease spots floating on the top of the broth.  Further, this red curry appeared to contain nothing but tiny pieces of chicken and onions, whereas Thai Elephant's is chock full of large pieces of chicken and perfectly cooked broccoli, zucchini, bell pepper, baby corn, carrots, mushrooms and onions.  In Thai Gourmet's version, I finally found a couple small pieces of baby corn and thin slices of bell pepper sunken to the bottom of the bowl.

My husband may be a bit jaded by a recent visit to another Thai place during a business trip to eastern Washington, but he too was disappointed by his Drunken Noodles.  He said they just didn't have the depth of flavor that he's come to expect in good Thai food.  As another reviewer commented, the noodles were broken in small pieces.  The vegetables were skimpy cuts and slightly overcooked.

Perhaps the regular chef called in sick or was training someone new.  Considering any place can have an off night, we may give them one more chance, but this time just split the pad thai and see how they do with that old standby.  Then, if we are again disappointed, at least it will have been a more economical experiment (I hate wasting dollars from our restaurant budget on mediocre food, but I guess at least it makes us appreciate the gems out there all the more).",5,1,1

Didn't eat, drink, gamble, or stay there.  Just walked through to check the place out. And it was amazing. Absolutely gorgeous.

The ceiling of the casino is painted like a sky, giving it a different feel from every other casino I was in.

Like NY-NY, the inside of the casino is as themed as the outside - restaurants and shops sit along Parisian streets, all under the blue sky that is the ceiling casino.

There is an elevator you're invited to ride as soon as you enter the casino.  It takes you up within the Eiffel Tower, letting you out in a kitchen scene right out of Ratatouille.  Walk around the corner and you're in the most gorgeous restaurant I saw in Vegas, looking out over the best views of the city.  Didn't see a menu, but I imagine it was priced to match.

Never got a chance to eat anywhere in Paris, though I wanted to... I thought I saw a relatively inexpensive place with brick oven pizza (I love anything ovened with brick) as well as a crepe place that unfortunately didn't have anything that really piqued my interest, but even so, I can always go for a crepe.

I emailed the logo over along with the addition of our website as requested. I was told I'd have a proof that afternoon, but that didn't happen. A few days later I received the proof and it was the old logo as well as no website added.
I called Josh and told him about the problem and it appears he never even looked at the email. The next day I received a revised proof but no website had been added. At this point about a week had gone by and I was getting tired of the lack of detail from a company that in the past had been so good. 
I called and asked for Josh and he said that things happen and that's what the proof process was for. Three times and a week later for something that if he would have taken the time to process it right wouldn't have been an issue.

I told them that I wanted to speak with Ernie the owner...he again stated, no I couldn't and that Ernie never came in anymore. I told him to cancel the order and credit my account back.
After me calling everyday for three days to confirm my order was cancelled and that it was credited back, I finally spoke with another employee that said the owner would be in shortly and to call back at that time. 
Finally after all this hassle I spoke with the owner and received my full refund. 
At this time I can not recommend this company until they get things straightened out. The currently manager has no idea what he is doing and lacks basic customer service skills. It's a shame that after 10 years of buying signs from them that I had to change. Where are you

They can do repairs; install items like fenders, racks and lights; sell you things like locks and helmets and pumps; and, they can sell you bikes. 

They have a tiny retail shop space which is more like a mechanics stand with a scattering of items for sale than it is like the shopping Nirvana of Holt Renfrew or Harry Rosen.  In the summer they have a nice little buzz about them, as they operate a lot of their business outside - bikes for sale on the boulevard, a temporary tent on a driveway for repairs, and wheels and more bikes crammed in a tiny adjoining garage.  

The staff are nice, not pushy and the shop has a vibe that it is owned and run by a couple of friends who really wanted to work with bikes all the time (I don't know if this is actually true...but it feels like it).  

If you're looking at high end MTB or road bikes, they can likely order a couple of them out of the lines they carry, but they don't have a lot of eye candy on display to get the drool reflex flowing, and don't specialize in this area enough to represent a lot of brands, models and sub-category items (e.g. trials, triathalon, downhill).

They will however, offer you personalized service, and help with a decent selection of commuter, cruiser or low to mid-range bikes.",6,2,7

We ended to on a promoter's list that helped us avoid the insanely long line, as well as the long promoters line.  We sailed in immediately- despite the inexplicably CRAAAAAZY long lines.  When we got in the club, it was extremely claustrophobic, PACKED to the gills with people, smoky as you could even IMAGINE- whatevers generic house music.  The worst two features were the ""blast smoke"" machine from the stage, and the inexcusably crowded venue.  They had this horrendous machine that blasted smoke\/chalky substance all over the dance floor every 30 seconds.  

It was literally so crowded you couldn't move ANYWHERE.  Instead of agreeing to be seated with a table of guys we decided to GET THE HECK OUT!!!

As other have mentioned, I did enjoy the decor, especially as we bellied up to the beautifully gnarled wood bar and took in the drink menu. A decent amount of by the glass options, and a more extensive than expected food menu, though I didn't really look to hard at it, and a (for the most part) full bar. They seemed to have some decent nightly drink specials during the week. 

The music switched between soft alternative(?) recordings and a live act, but overall very relaxing for those starting their evening off slow and others just enjoying a meal. If I'm ever looking for a low-key atmosphere uptown, I'll definitely think of Wooden Vine.  Not too crowded, great staff, are there better wine bars in Charlotte? Yes. Are there better wine bars on Tryon open late? Nothing comes to mind. 

Taking it from a four star to a three: with one stall restrooms for each sex, a woman thought it would be okay to hog the bathroom for something other than its purpose (I'll let you draw your own conclusions), maybe not the WV's fault, but she felt comfortable enough there to do it. Also, chefs and cooks coming out to the bar to fill up their drinks from the soda gun doesn't really bother me, I've done the same thing and I don't mind seeing who cooks the food, but having one come up using a plastic food storage container as his cup?

Just went for Summerlicious. Group of 7, 6:30 PM reservation on a Sunday evening. 

Bad sign first off ... our server introduced herself, asked if we wanted water (not if we preferred tap or sparkling, whatever, just if we wanted water at all?), and then proceeded to disappear for the rest of the evening. Really. We saw her walking back and forth all evening, but she never approached our table again. At least two different other people served us instead ... which is fine, unless somebody introduced herself and told you she was your server. 

As we waited for our friend, we eventually wondered whether we could get drinks, and made eye contact with a server. We asked if we could order drinks, and he was like, ""Oh, of course!"" and took our orders. This was about 15-20 minutes after our initial reservation time. 

As we ordered drinks, I asked if we could have separate bills, knowing not every place can accommodate, and he said, ""yeah, of course."" When we got our bill (different server), it was one bill and she apologized for not being able to separate the bill, but we could pay with multiple cards if needed. Okay! Don't mind that ... if you can keep your story straight. 

One of the busboys kept our glasses filled (until dessert), which was appreciated, and offered fresh pepper for our first and main courses. 

We had to ask for bread, only after we noticed some other tables got bread. Appreciated the presentation, with warmed butter for spreading, but again, we each got one tiny slice, which meant we all kept eyeing the board, wondering which half of the group got a second slice. 

Suffered a bit from the Summerlicious stereotype ... portions skimpy. 

The caprese salad came with one sprig of basil, like a garnish. Perhaps a different style? The grilled calamari was tasty, and came with a generous side of greens, which was excellent. 

The lobster agnolotti was tasty but the portion was a little mean. The lamb with mint was three very skinny slices. The stuffed chicken and snapper dishes fared better. All around we did enjoy our dishes, which were relatively simple but well-executed. For $25, what can you really ask for? If you have a more modest appetite, this is perfect; if not, perhaps think of dropping into Sud Forno down the street for a pick-me-up.

Monday came around and my friend & I was still in Vegas. She told me weeks before our trip that she wanted to check out the Bare Pool place on Monday before we left. She asked if I would like to join her. (F yeah!)

This Bare Pool is located in the Mirage. We got slightly lost looking for the spot. Finally we arrived and through some miracle (and my friend's charm) we got in for free. We got there at around 1PM so there were the perfect amount of people: not too busy, not too slow.

We did what we normally did: bathroom stop, off with the covers, and walk right back out. I saw down for a bit in the pool. I tried out the environment first. I felt pretty chill and comfortable after a few minutes then off my bikini top goes. I didn't feel like people were staring, just simply relaxing at the pool having a good time. I think I was the 2nd person there to go topless. I thought it was a little surprising since it was Las Vegas; I figure everyone there are more bold then me. (I guess not! lol)

We stayed there for a few hours to get rid of out tan lines we had for the past few days at the pool parties.

About 4PM people started to show up. I guess I felt like the obnoxious crowded started to fill up the spot. Why did I feel that way you say? There were scattered drunk individuals who were obnoxiously loud. I started to feel like I was at a nightclub in Downtown San Jose. I sat up most of the time and just scanned the area. I guess my friend notice that I'm starting to feel uncomfortable so she said, ""lets go.""

This is because I love them, and Southern California continues to crank out one boutique burger joint after the other. That last part is relevant because if you live in an area with a high concentration of good burger options, chances are you won't be overly impressed with Ramsay's Burgr. That isn't to say this is bad, or even mediocre, but it isn't providing something I haven't had already. 

For one thing, the lengthy line out front is barely justified. I had to wait over 30 minutes just to get a seat for a burger. I know it's all because of whose burger it is, still sucked. 

I started off with the truffle fries, which come with a garlic aioli and a fancy house ketchup. They were delicious, especially with the aioli. I wasn't too hot on the ketchup. To me, ketchup is one of those condiments that shouldn't be messed with too much. I don't use it often, but when I do I expect the flavor to be consistent. 

The blue burger seemed to be their standard offering, so I went with that. It's very simple, which allows for the meat to do most of the talking. It told me that it's tender and succulent and juicy, so I devoured it. The toppings only consisted of a little arugula and some blue cheese. The bun was excellent, some kind of seed-y, doughy bread. Could've done with a bit of a toasting on the inside, but that's only a minor complaint.

When you walk in you don't really know what to expect. Is this going to be just mobsters and collectibles? Is it going to be dry and be as fun as an encyclopedia? Will the admission be worth it?

I'm glad to report this museum is highly interactive with numerous collectibles of the mob and their accessories throughout the years. Not only that, it takes a very interesting take on the entire culture, history, and effect the mob has had to American culture. Along with 3 floors of content you can spend hours diving into not just the lives of mobsters but the counter culture and system attempting to combat it. The narratives of people's lives start getting into your system and strangely as time goes by, the more personal the stories become. You start to care for not just the victims of the mob but the members themselves. I never would've thought I would have such a grand time here but I'm so glad I went.

We met with John to discuss our needs, goals and dreams for the pool and patio area. We had a size, design and features all ready in our head, we just needed it put on paper to see if feasible. 

 On our second meeting we had our CAD drawings presented to us and he told us that because of us having to wait for funding after closing of the home, that we should sign the ""price lock contract"" so that once the new costs for the year for contractors and materials came about, that we would be locked in for last years rates.  We asked if we needed to put down a deposit or anything, but were advised that this was just to lock in the prices, and we would get a final contract once we were closer to building.

John was very nice to deal with when we first started this project.  However, it took a turn when my husband returned from overseas, where he works for 60 days at a time.  We wanted to change the design of the pool a little bit and he revamped the estimate of what the new cost would be, which we realized was not going to be possible for getting financing from.  We were referred to another pool company by a neighbor for an estimate on the same design.  

We called to advise John at Blue Wave that we were not going to be able to do our pool thru him, because of cost.  We were not able to get funded for the amount of the pool design that we planned. Marsha emailed us back to let us know that they were sorry we weren't able to use them.  

We left John a voicemail stating that we found another vendor who was able to give us everything we asked for and included the higher cost travertine full porch along with the Pentair in ground cleaning system, which were not included in the Blue Wave estimate due to cost. We were hoping that John would return our call to see if he could price match.  This new estimate was $15000 cheaper with all the extras. However, he never called that day or the next, so we signed a contract with our new company and gave a $1000 deposit.

The 3rd day my husband was driving to the airport to catch his flight to Afghanistan, when John proceeded to call and berate him for switching companies and not giving him a chance to match the price. He said we were ""stupid"" for choosing someone else, that we were ""not going to get good quality for that price,"" and plenty of other things.  The topper was that he advised us that he ""was going to file a cease and desist""order so that our new pool builder couldn't build a pool for us either.  My husband was livid that someone in this industry would berate a client, or potential client and not try to be respectful, knowing that word of mouth is the best form or worst form of advertising.  

We took our paperwork to a lawyer, and paid $500 to have him look it over, where he advised us and Blue Wave pools that there was no breach of contract, since no money exchanged hands. He advised us that he would reach out to Blue Wave to attempt to resolve this conflict peacefully.  John at Blue Wave refused his attempts for multiple calls and finally left a voice mail stating he would ""settle for $500"" and that ""payment needs to be in the form of a cashiers check as I no longer trust the Hibler's.""  This voicemail was saved and played to me by the lawyers office.

Had John asked us to at least pay for the CAD drawings, we gladly would have done so and saved ourselves $500 in attorney fees and the extra wasted money that John took in the $500. (no CAD drawings cost that much)

We reported his company and his horrible customer service to Maracay Homes and advised them to not refer their potential clients to him, as the service when things don't go his way, gets ugly.",38,10,0

Craving Greek, I went her with a friend on her recommendation, and the food was definitely delicious! 

We had the trio of dips to start, served with a basket of warm pita. Two of the dips, the hummus and tzatziki, were absolutely delicious, while the third (the fishy one?) was kind of questionable. I would definitely recommend doing the ""two dips"" appetizer instead. 

For a main, we both had the ""Small Chicken Souvlaki"". The chicken is tender and well seasoned, and I'm sooo happy they took it off the skewer. I hate wrestling with those. This was served with a Greek salad, potatoes, rice, and a smear of tzatziki. So while the food was good, it wasn't the most attractive presentation ever.... it kind of looked like they had just used a spatula and wiped the side of my plate with tzatziki... a little gross... and the plate was kind of empty overall, even though there was a ton of food. 

While the servers were really sweet and nice, they were a little slow and it took forever to get our bill. When we got the bill I found out my diet coke cost almost as much as a glass of wine (lesson learned, always drink), and in total, we spent $30 each for something that maybe should have cost $20, max.

So while this was a good experience, I think it would have been better if it was take-out. The food is delicious, but for the price, everything else could have been a little better.",1,1,1

NokE7MFKW29NEdmqagg7xg,ig3N6o0d8fBxGQ2WV--klQ,ztCmuPxfKf3_L3QjUCYMHQ,1,2014-08-01,"Today I was shocked by the disrespect of the finance team at this dealership.  Auto Nation has a strong reputation for excellent service so I was highly disappointed by the manner in which I was treated.  I personally have done business with Auto Nation stores many times, most recently when purchasing my Audi S4. It was an excellent customer service experience in which I received a 4% interest rate and financed 100% of the loan in the business name.  I know that this experience is not a reflection of the Auto Nation brand as a whole. 

We purchased a vehicle from this dealership approximately a week ago. The terms of the loan needed to be renegotiated and the owner of the company's signature was required.  The original term that was offered was unacceptable- a 22% interest rate. We do an extensive amount of business with Ford Motor Credit and are always treated with complete courtesy by them. I have never been offered such a high rate. We just purchased two Ford Rangers for our business and financed 100% of each loan completely in our business name at approximately 5% for each loan. The transactions were done separately at two different Ford stores. The loan sizes were comparable to the transaction we were trying to complete with this dealership.  I have complete faith in Ford Motor Credit and also know that this is not a reflection of their service.

Jeff Beacham, the finance manager, and Eric Strecker, the internet manager, both treated me as if they were collecting on a past due loan.  It felt like I was a 'debtor' being harassed by an aggressive collector.  I'm shocked because you might have expected this type of treatment after months of not paying on a loan, but not after a few days of having a vehicle that simply needed to be re-contracted.  The voicemail that was left was a total breach of privacy and should not have been left on a business voicemail, nor should anyone at my office have been given the details of this contract as they have nothing to do with the loan. 

As a towing company we are often faced with quite extensive and large balance equipment loans. We purchased a used Ford Focus. This was not a high balance loan. They continued to tell me that I needed to 'pay for the loan' or 'bring the vehicle back.'  I explained that the owner of our company was out of state on a business trip, but they pushed and pushed with follow up questions as if they thought this was not true. I only answered the phone after hours because it seemed important, not to be treated with such contempt.  They mocked the size of our business and the owner's busy schedule claiming that they had the same taxing lifestyle. 

Being a business owner is much different from being an employee of a large corporation. When asked who managed the dealership as a whole, Jeff Beacham first stated that it was him.  When pressed for the GM's info they laughed and said to tell him that they said hi when we contact him.   I intend to return this vehicle and do business elsewhere as I do not want to provide a sales incentive to a company that does not appreciate my business. As a company that purchases many vehicles each year, I want to provide my business to a dealership that cares. This does not seem to be a dealership that values customer service.",1,0,0

After reading about really great gluten-free pizza done with care, a friend and I tried Project Pie for dinner. It wasn't busy by the time we got there and so I could ask a lot of questions. One review I had read said that the staff takes care to use different utensils AND that they put the gluten-free crust in a separate metal pan before putting in their oven. 

I didn't find any of this to be true on my visit. The staff did robotically say ""we are a gluten-filled environment and can't guarantee cross-contamination,"" but they honestly seemed to have no idea about what food allergies were as they used the same oil brushes and did not cook my pizza in a dedicated pan.

Because we had just gotten off the plane and were starving, I didn't have any other dinner options at the time. I was mildly sick after eating, but no extreme reactions. The pizza I had was good (hence the two stars) and the prices fair, but the lack of staff training and nonchalance is a major downside and reflects my rating.

Project Pie is NOT safe for Celiacs as they seemed to have changed their policies on food handling from the reviews that I've read online. If you have extreme sensitivities and intolerances, it would be best to go elsewhere for pizza.",1,2,1

While there is an extensive menu the quality of the food is quite low. The smoked meat is quite lean which was great, but it is tasteless. Our fries were delivered to another table and then given to us cold. We sent them back 1 because we saw them put on the other table and 2 because cold fries are not good. The fresh lemonade does not taste like lemonade at all. It is very syrupy. The matzo ball soup is very salty and not at all what you woukd expect from a deli.  I was very disappointed with the latkas as well They were very oily and thin with very little taste. Our server was quite nice very friendly and chatty. If you are looking for a high quality deli I wouldn't recommend going here. I feel it's more about the theme than quality. If you are ok with mediocre food that will be served cold it's for you!

I'm a huge fan of Indian food, and have had my fair share. I came here with a frequent patron who claimed this place is the best in Vegas, and even she said that the food didn't taste how it normally should. The flavor profiles were all off. 

Chicken tikka masala- 1 star. The curry didn't taste right. no richness, not much buttery or creamy flavor. 

Paneer saag with chicken (spinach dish)- 1star. I wasn't too impressed. Nothing too special about this dish.

Aloo gobi (potatoes and cauliflower) - 1 star. Cauliflower was overcooked, mushy, and lacked flavor. 

Garlic naan- 1 star. The dough was undercooked in certain areas. 

Samosas with minced lamb-2 stars. 
I've always gotten potatoes or vegetarian so lamb was a first. Inside was good, but the breading was really strange. It was super doughy and over-fried making the texture almost as crunchy as biting into a rock. Not like I know what that's like...

Service- 5 stars. Our glasses were constantly full, they are on top of their game. 

The highlight of my dinner was the green sauce and tamarind sauce they give you at the beginning with some fried stuff. That's about it. I'm a bit afraid to give this place a second shot after my experience as I was really looking forward to it.",9,1,1

Marilyn was my make-up artist and she threw down in the glam department! I was headed to a wedding in a few hours and she dolled me up in 1hr! Its a great package deal because for a full face makeover you're required to buy $50 worth of make up which kills two birds with one stone if you're worried about buying supplies for vacation. You can just come to Vegas and purchase your goodies here! I gave Marilyn the concept I wanted, which was a smokey eye and ombre lips and also told her I wasn't afraid for her to build on the foundation because I needed it to last all day and night! Boy did it last! It lasted until 6am when I finally went to bed! Lol! She was so skilled at her artistry, was very personable, and has been working in the industry for a while! This Sephora location is lucky to have her! 

To start she cleansed and moisturized me with towelettes that were great products. She completed my look with lines from: Lancôme, Giorgio Armani, Becca, Kat Von D, Smash Box and Urban Decay. I love Sephora more than Mac make-overs because you're not restricted to just one line of makeup but rather have a vast selection of the best brands to your disposal.

To be fair, I'm not going to compare this place to my spots in Cali because Gen doesn't stand a chance for many reasons. On that note, I think it's common knowledge that the kbbq scene in Las Vegas is pretty weak and leaves much to be desired. Sorry, but it's true.

Enter Gen House. First impression: Ohh my my my.. The atmosphere is definitely chic, like something you should come to expect for a kbbq spot in Las Vegas (I know it's in Henderson, but whatever). Gen is centrally located in a mall, so parking is of no issue. Waiting in line, however, can be sporadic, much like most kbbq places.

Like I said earlier, I can't compare this place with my spots in Cali, but I can, however, compare the service. Enter Jaenica (heart and music note). She was simply amazing; I couldn't ask for a better server. Seriously, she's the best, I can't emphasize that enough. She catered to our needs very quickly and was very entertaining to talk to--cute, too.

There's nothing much to say as far as the food goes, other than that it was pretty standard for what you would expect for a ayce kbbq. Nonetheless, I do have two gripes: kimchi and bean sprouts. I don't even know where to begin, but of all the sides, kimchi reigns supreme and should not be compromised. The ones we got were watery and were mainly the rooted end of the cabbage--very disappointing. On the other hand, the bean sprouts, second in line to the throne, is missing in action! Where are my bean sprouts?! Seriously, Gen, get it together.

All things considered, I definitely recommend this place for your ayce kbbq needs. This is the spot in Vegas, hands down, no doubt about it. Still in all, I'm inclined to give Gen only 3 stars because of the kimchi and bean sprouts ordeal. I know I sound like I'm nitpicking, but these are Korean staples, so add more love in the kimchi and bring on the bean sprouts! But to sum it up, this place deserves 4 stars since Jaenica made such a great impression on me with her outstanding service and witty humor. I shall return--bookmarked.",0,0,0

Anyways, all joking aside, I took a quick through their menu and of course my eyes landed on the noodles section. All the noodles in that section are all cold noodle options. I wanted bibim naengmyeon and LA galbi ($13.50) so I got that.

The bibim naengmyeon comes out with buckwheat noodles neatly piled into a metal steel bowl then layered with thinly sliced pickled radish, asian pear and strips of julienne cucumbers. The broth and the gochujang sauce comes separate so you can add the right amount of both to you desired liking. I really like that since some people might not like their bibim naengmyeon soaking in broth (order the mul naengmyeon if you want lots of broth!) or too over spicy. Sadly I forgot to take a picture after it was all mixed...oops.

The LA galbi came out on a sizzling plate which was great. The meat was nice, tender and very well marinated. The meat practically felt off the bone, the cartilage part that was left on the bone was very chewy but very delicious, the marinade marinated so well into all of the meat that I have no complains.

Banchan was the usual but OMG the pajeon was incredible! It was so so so good. A simple onion pancake with some red peppers added, it was so fluffy and full of flavour. The other banchan was kimchi, pickled radish with jalapenos and fishcake.

I will definitely come back again. Service was impeccable too. The waitress also helped me with the bibim naengmyeon since it had been a while since I had it and I never got it unmixed so I wasn't really sure what to do. Good job Lim Ga Ne.",0,0,0

The room is an adequate size. A bit smaller than I expected, but still some space if you move the furniture around. There's a couch with a pull out bed and two flat screens (one in front of the couch and the other in front of the bed.

There were no Aveda products like other reviewers had mentioned. We got the deluxe suite so maybe they only have them when you upgrade? 

Not really convenient when walking to the strip.   Even though only a mile walk, it's not centrally located. It's sort of tucked away between Aria and the Cosmopolitan.

I had the ""eggs benedict"" with scrambled eggs.  I asked for the hollandaise on the side.  Their version doesn't have an English muffin, if you want one on the side, it will cost you 3.95( wow).  The eggs benedict was 15.95 or 17.95, I cant remember.  It also came with 4 stalks of really tough asparagus.  The hollandaise was served in a tiny cup.  This version also contains scalloped potatoes.  Very weird and those were not cooked thru. 

My cousin had banana bread French toast which was just that.  A really thick, hard piece of banana bread that was made into French toast.  It was hard to eat and crumbled with every forkful she took.  

My wife had 3 tiny little waffles( I'm sure they were frozen) that were supposed to taste like a cinnamon roll.  They didn't.  It was not worth the price. 

My cousin also had a 5.00 hot chocolate that they charged me 6.50 for and called it chocolate milk.  I told the waiter it was hot chocolate and he said yes, that's what we charge and I had to show him the menu where it says "" Hot chocolate"", 4.95.  Jeez.

Some coworkers and I were going to see a movie after work, and since the movie started a few hours later, we decided to meet at BBD for a quick bite. This week BBD is participating in the ""Yelp Shares the Love"" promotion, donating the proceeds from dessert sales to Three Square, so we had even better reason to visit.

First of all, it's easy to find and there is plenty of parking. I used to go to the nail salon in the same center - boy do I wish that BBD would have been there back then!

It's casual, but nice.  You order at the counter and seat yourself. When your food is ready, they bring it to you.

The cashier was super friendly and helpful. I ordered the Pho Dip for myself and the Dragon Fries to share with the group. 

It didn't take long for the food to come out. Now, I was quite excited to try the Pho Dip, since I've heard such great things about it.  It's a wonderfully creative sandwich - and I like both Pho and French dips (separately), but I hate to say that the combo of the 2 did not really blow me away.  It's nothing against BBD, just personal taste.  The bread was good and was able to stand up to dipping, which is always important.  The beef was also tasty. Unfortunately, the addition of the pickled bean sprouts, cilantro and basil just made the sandwich too sweet for me (if that even makes sense). I was missing a ""kick"" of some kind to off-set the sweetness.

The dragon fries were freaking amazing! They are basically garlic fries with Thai chili - although I didn't find them too spicy.  They come with kimchi ketchup on the side. Funny thing - I don't like ketchup and I don't like kimchi, but together they were freaking fantastic! Please order these fries if you go, you won't regret it (unless you are a wimp and can't take the heat)!

My friend ordered the Thai Clam Chowder and Szechuan Shrimp Po-Boy. Both were really delicious (I tasted both, of course!).  However, she is a pescatarian and was surprised to find bacon in the soup. It's our fault, since the item is not marked as vegetarian on the menu (or meatless), but we were surprised this wasn't mentioned on the menu at all.  So, beware if you don't eat pork!  The po-boy was really good. The shrimp was crispy and really tasty. I would definitely order this item.

We also each ordered a dessert. They had a selection of cupcakes to choose from. I went with the lemon cupcake, with lemon frosting. 2 others went with the green tea cupcake.  Although the frosting was really good, the cupcake itself was quite dry. However, it was for charity, and I wouldn't normally order dessert, so I am certainly not complaining!!

Overall, it was a great dinner. It's an interesting concept and they are wildly creative! It's a local, family owned business, and that alone deserves support! I definitely suggest stopping in for a quick bite if you are in the area!",4,1,3

 First of all, I have to agree with the below reviewer. Our table was slightly dirty. The restaurant itself was cold and although the waiter was very helpful to the point of nervousness, I can't say I was too impressed with the food. I mean, it was okay but nothing too spectacular. Maybe it's because it was a weekday evening but there wasn't much atmosphere either.


 I highly doubt I'll be back but I reckon it makes sense as an addition to Dalry road and will probably do well in the area as there's not much else to choose from in the way of mid price range sit in restaurants.

I had the burger, and a Greek cheese appetizer. Though not bad, both where nothing to talk about. Burger and fries where $18. You better cook a mean burger for that price.

My friend had a pasta type dish (can't remember what it was called) that was pretty tasty. It had some kick to it. I wish I ordered that instead. It was not great, but had more flavour than the burger.

His response was the word ""um"" in which he easily used 10 times within a minute. He just kept saying um. And after asking over and over he was like,  um what?  You wanna know how much 1 philly cheese steak pizza is? Finally he says oh a medium is $10 and a large is $16. So we ordered the medium. Each time he needed to ask us a question,  like are you paying cash or cc and can i have a name, it was a project for him. A real struggle. We go pick up the pizza and he charges us $15. So we are like,  we just called and you said $10. Oh, um.. um.. um.. I must've told you the price for a small. A manager comes out and totally brushes the situation off and is like no a medium specialty is $15. We told him that we called and specifically asked the price and was told $10. He honestly didn't really care, was unapologetic and just walked away. AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. Ordering a pizza over the phone shouldn't be so hard and knowing your prices and product is important. And if your going to have a new person answer the phone,  give them a price list, train them or tell them to ask whatever they don't know.

I will say that the experience has been rocky from the start. The first time I came in they were slammed and the owner Denny asked me to come back later that same day for a pedi, nail removal and new gel overlay. I said yes to that and returned later that evening. As one of their last clients of the day I did get my pedi that night but no one had soaked my nails in preparation for the gel overlay. I was asked again to come back, which I did at 9:00 am the next morning but low and behold they could soak my nails off but no one was available to do the gel overlay. Finally after several attempts and much patience on my part my services were completed. 

Trip #2 went significantly better with a fill and the VIP pedicure. 

Then this last Thursday I made an appointment for myself and my daughter for gel and pedi services. When we arrived at 4:30 there were maybe 10 people being helped, yet there was a distinct sense of chaos. No one seemed to have a clear understanding of who we were or who was helping us for which service. I didn't make a big deal I let them figure it out and waited. After about 5 minutes we finally got started, I had someone new who never gave me her name. I'm always open to a new experience so I didn't make a fuss, I went with it. No major debacle here or so I thought... once we were in better lighting I noticed  that my nails had shallow spots where not enough gel was applied. Then about an hour later I picked up a fork and one of my nails broke at the tip of my finger. I did try to go back when I was in the area on Saturday to see if they could at least fix the one nail that had broken. As always the place was a mad house with people waiting. The owner Denny asked me who helped me and seriously I had no clue since the nail tech had never given me her name. Finally when I found her and told him who it was he said she had just started with someone and asked me to come back several hours later.  Remembering what had happened on trip #1 I just said that I could not come back.  To that he made some wise crack stating that he didn't want to make me wait for someone because then I would be mad at him if it took awhile and he chuckled. 

I was looking at him and it hit me, in all of these things that had happened in my 1st and my last visit he had never once apologized for the lack of organization or the poor Service I had received. Even as I read through the return comments for poor ratings it's more a matter circumstance and not poor planning on the part of the organization. I cracked up on the one that stated that a delay was due to Mother's Day being within a few days. Sure Mother's Day is busy but that doesn't mean that you have to double book your staff.  Obviously you have a problem booking appointments and understanding what your clients want or you would not have the same complaint on yelp multiple times. 

Needless to say I will not be going back... I have already found a new salon that is less expensive, friendlier and has more services than Scottsdale Hand and Foot. When they saw my nails they immediately made the corrections that you should have.

Maybe we just made the mistake of coming on Valentine's Day but this experience almost makes me want to never come back again. We were there for an hour and 45 minutes while having nothing in front of us for a majority of the time except for dirty plates. Our first part of what we ordered arrived about 5 minutes after we ordered it (screaming-O) and the next course of uni and salmon nigiri followed 5 minutes later. After that we didn't get anything for almost 25 minutes. Every individual item came out about 20 minutes spaced out. We ended up cancelling a lot of what we ordered just cause we didn't want to wait any longer. My husband never complains and even he was getting frustrated. Might have to wait at least 6 months before I think about stepping back in there. They need better service and betters  sushi chefs.,2,2,0

We decided to drop by here for a quick lunch before Marquee Dayclub, since it's right outside Marquee's main entrance on the 2nd level. For some reason or another, we decided to sit in the bar and lounge area, instead of the dining area. The lounge had a few couches and chairs and we found a spot that fit seven of us. The rest of our group decided to sit at the bar.

Not all of us ate, and I honestly don't even remember if I had a burger or not. If I did, it was obviously pretty unmemorable. I do remember getting fries and those were pretty standard. I also remember the service being on the poor side, but it wasn't a big deal. At that time, if you checked in on Foursquare, you could get a free pint of beer. Our server said all 10 of us had to check in and show him the check-in for us to get it. Not all of us had Foursquare or cell service, so that was kind of irritating and inefficient. I mean, technically he didn't do anything wrong, but you know there are always those servers who are more lax and will get you the freebie without actually seeing the check-in. This guy was not one of those servers.

Every time I pass by Holsteins since then, I get bad vibes so I doubt I'd ever come back, unless it's for convenience. If I'm going to Dayclub, I'd rather get bottle service and food from Marquee, which is surprisingly tasty, than eat at Holsteins again.",4,2,2

We weren't looking for a romantic dinner, as after spending all day at her conference, the wife had to ""send a few emails, and quickly look at something for work"", which destroyed any chance of date night.  We weren't inspired by the Aria's in-room dining options, and know that Thai is often a decent choice to offer alternatives with her gluten allergy.  

Make no mistake, we didn't expect a terribly authentic Thai experience.  The signs were a broad menu that included udon, sesame chicken, and pho, and the fact that their signature beverage is a Watermelon Caipiroska.  I'm not sure why their menu covers so much of Asia, as there are separate Chinese and Japanese dining alternatives at the Aria.  But, that's neither here nor there, as we were after the usually-GF Thai stuff.

Because the wife was going to be busy, we just were going to pick up and bring it back to the room.  We both went downstairs, in case there were questions my wife would need to answer.  The young lady working the hostess stand on a Sunday night was, honestly, more friendly than we expected.  She walked us through our allergen questions, quickly dispatched our order, and before we could comment very long on the what looked like young, fit, and well-dressed platform-heeled blonde twins going to the secure Tower Suite elevators with what looked like their very affectionate dad, she came out with our bag of goodies.

We just went with a straight up chicken ""Phad Thai"" (not used to that spelling).  I didn't find it overly spicy, nor did we ask for extra hot sauce to customize it with.  Even though it took a bit of time for us to get back to our room, the food wasn't ""stuck together"" like some report here.  I was expecting to be underwhelmed, and come back downstairs to grab a pizza slice or something for my dinner later, but the ($18) entree was plenty to feed us both.  

So, for the ability to handle my wife's gluten allergy without worry, the nice hostess who helped us, and conveniently and quickly feeding us both for about $20, we were pretty happy.

When you line up to order, someone takes your drink order first and starts making your drink.....and then you order your food separately. That sounds great...because it seems like it's more efficient, but then when we paid, we realized that the person that took our drink order didn't communicate that with the person that rung us up, we ended up not paying for the drinks, so we didn't get any drinks, and we only got our food.

Our server was Wombo who was very kind and had good knowledge of the menu. Some of the girls ordered appetizers to start then entrees later.

No grill marks wtf! I had to send it back, next the hash brows had no flavor, I get they are simple but how do you mess that up ? Anyways asked for sausage links instead, brought me patties. So basically didn't eat meat I asked to remove the meat all together as soon as I saw, which they did. As for my boyfriends his cheesy eggs looked like liquid disgusting. I think my 5 year old could do a better job. I told the person checking us out how horrible my meal  was, you would think she would remove it. Clearly they don't care!

My boyfriend and I went here last Monday and were wowed by the friendly service, simple and cozy setting, and the fantastic food. 

He had a veal dish, and I had the flat iron peppercorn steak in a demi-glace sauce after we shared the escargot. 

The escargot was a fresh take on the original plating and preparation of the dish, but it was a yummy creation for sure. 

The only thing that put me off a little was that our plates were very warm-probably from the use of heat lamps in the kitchen. I usually tend to steer away from heat lamp users-as it takes away from the freshness of a dish- but otherwise that, I have no complaints. 

Beautiful wine list, excellent service, warm atmosphere and incredible dishes-you won't be disappointed!",0,0,0

However, this week in September, there were SLAMMIN' deals at some of the classier hotels, so along with the incentive of the FREE Phantom of the Opera ticket, the Venetian it was.

The room was lovely, very elegantly decorated, but honestly I feel the best part about staying here was the location.  Don't get me wrong - it's a BEAUTIFUL building.  Every time I walked outside of the hotel or approached it, I could hardly believe this was where my hotel room was it's so breath taking.  So it's beautiful, and maybe the most perfect location to stay at on the Strip.  The Mirage and Treasure Island are right across Las Vegas Boulevard, the Wynn is a short walk up north, and everything else is just a little bit south!  

The Canal shops are entertaining and fun to walk through.  Also along the path are several wonderful places to eat.  We ate at Z'efferino, which I HIGHLY recommend for you fine diners.

Let me stress that the only reason why I wanted to review this place is because I think a lot of people share my same thoughts on this hotel, which is a cheap stay at a great LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! 

My fiance, at the time, and I decided to stay here given the location and the ridiculously low rate we received at about $35\/night for a Tuesday - Saturday stay!  We decided we could try and suck it up for 4 nights in order to spend more money on the tables.  Also, the location of IP is very very ideal...as it is basically located at the heart of the strip making it accessible to pretty much everything.  

I think after first walking in and seeing the cheesy-themed casino, and shortly after seeing our room I knew we were in for the life of luxury, hahaha.  I can say after our stay at IP I will always fork out more money now to stay at other great location casinos, such as the Bellagio.  

At the time of our stay, I absolutely dreaded coming back even for just a cat nap to our room.  The room was so rundown, maid service was a hit or miss, and the towels made me feel like I just couldn't keep clean!  I can laugh about it now fortunately.

You may wonder why 2 stars....well if you are looking for a cheap stay(one star) and literally just a place to sleep at a great location on the strip (the other star) then IP might not be such a bad stay.",5,2,2

The great: The setting and the design of the restaurant is spectacular.  Its beautiful.  A modern structure jetting out into the natural setting of the falls.  Heck, I've driven by here 20 times and didn't know there were falls, let alone a place like this.  So my visual needs have been satisfied.

The good: My date and I had good service.  So there ya go.  My emotional needs were satisfied.

The just okay: So the next step is ordering.  It's a basic menu, with what you would expect at a place like this.  I can't judge the steaks, because I only go the steak route at steak houses, but the pork and chicken entrees were just okay.  The beef tenderloin skewer was overcooked beef on a stick, stay clear.  The Piatto salad with red wine vinaigrette was a joke.  It was lettuce, on a plate, with a touch of dressing.  The Chicken Arrosto was definitely tasty, but the potatoes were under the chicken and soggy.  They also had a pork special, which was HUGE, but sometimes you sacrifice flavor with size, and that was the case here.

Super friendly service. Bartender is very attentive.

We usually come here after work, late night, early morning. Crowds already gone. Front door is locked for safety. Must ring bell for entrance!

My favorite items from menu:
Grilled chicken and avocado sandwich with fries.
Chicken is tender, cheese is perfectly melted. Tomato slices, red onions and avocado are greatly enhancing the sandwich.
Steak and eggs with hash brown and a choice of toast. The breakfast steak is 6 oz., and it can be a hit or miss. I never had any problems, but last weekend my BF didn't like the steak at all. It had a very sour taste ... I guess to vinegary ... I don't know ... 
Anyway, bartender immediately apologized for not liking the meat, and offered something else from the menu. Also took it off from the bill. No arguments, no ifs and no buts ... very easy transaction. His attitude made the whole experience absolutely great!

Some locals have timeshares nearby, but if it hadn't been for a conference, I doubt I would have stumbled upon this place. 

The off-strip location seems to make SP ideal for conventions. There are oodles of conference spaces: enough to usually accommodate our 11,000 attendees. The hotel, food and security staff and food provided for the conference were very nice. Conference rooms were comfortable, although there was some trouble accessing wifi & cell signals in some rooms. There's an in-house casino (because duh, this is Vegas!) and a variety of eateries with different price ranges. It's far enough from the Strip to not distract conference attendees, but there also are free shuttles to the Strip as well as to a great shopping area called Las Vegas Town Square. There are also airport shuttles available, depending on the time of day. 

Speaking of shuttles, our driver to Town Square, Bob, was a wealth of information and humor as he drove us around. He informed us that SP is local family-owned and supports the local residents. Sounds good to me! He also told us some other tidbits, gave is dining tips, and regaled us with stories about his life. He's a regular sit-down comedy act!! Warning: don't sit in the back row is the bus if you value your backside or are carrying any open liquids. 

Getting back to the hotel...I was stunned when I entered my room. I had already read others Yeeps' reviews stating that SP is not a high-end hotel so my expectations were blown away. The room, including 2-room sink & shower\/toilet area was easily 800 SF, and that's for a room with one bed!! It was nicely furnished with a small dinner table and chairs, desk and love seat. And I still had space to wander aimlessly in the room. Room decor was nice, and the little curtain canopy around the headboard was ""like a princess"", to quote a friend. There was ample lighting...I never turned on all the lights as there were  just too many! Something that I love about SP: when you turn on the water or shower, it doesn't smell like a swimming pool! They must filter their water because it's not all chlorine stinky like other (fancier strip) hotels which I won't name. IMO, the lower end details that I saw were in the quality of the TP, kleenex & linens, and the fact that they don't provide bathrobes and slippers in your room

Since we all need our devices, I located and counted 8 (eight!!) easily accessible electrical plugs! I loved that I could check out via the tv remote!!

Housekeeping did a nice job on my room. And my housekeeper, Raina, was so honest! I left some cash on the table to tip her when she cleaned my room, but when I came back, she hadn't even touched it!

Oh! One more thing--my co-worker, being a low maintenance guy, kept his ""Do Not Disturb"" tag on his door all week and didn't request service. On the 4th day of our stay, Security paid him a visit. It's their policy to check on a guest after 3 days, just to make sure everything is ok. Nice touch & smart move!

There's a very nice spa, salon and gym in the building. Gym equipment seemed modern and in nice working order, and I guess for extra motivation, the treadmills overlooked the pool. The pool was quite nice, and pretty sheltered from desert winds, too.

Tips:
There's a coupon book with some good deals in it. Carry it around the hotel. 
There are meal deals at some restaurants. How about a burger & fries for $4.99 or a Mexican lunch for $7.95? If you're up for food from 12:00-6:00 am, there are other breakfast deals, too!
If you're not into all the casino smoke, there are a few routes in & out via conference room areas to escape the smog. 
The pool area is a nice place to catch some fresh air, but if it's too cold or hot, the conference area lobby has comfortable couches and chairs where you can relax. It's nice & quiet when not being used and employees don't seem to mind if you hang out there. 
The public restrooms are very clean.",7,4,6

This is not our first time here- the first time my husband and I went, we LOVED the food and the service.  We couldn't get over the delicious Bacon! Bacon! Bacon! Appetizer and the Huge, yummy burgers! 

However, this time, we brought our kids with us as we were celebrating a special family event and the events of the evening (Service & food) absolutely tainted the rest of the night and the mood of our celebration!  We ordered the yummy Bacon appetizer that we'd been telling the kids about and when it arrived- it was cold, floppy bacon covered in congealed grease! The smell alone was off putting and we were dumb founded! We sent it back and our nice waitress was horrified that the busboy, brought this ""Unacceptable"" product out!  When she returned with it she told us that they put it on the grill - UH, not even my kids would eat it! Sent it back-and moved on with the meal- still trying to keep our smiling celebrating faces as others who arrived well after us- were getting their meals- (So, no appetizer, no meal) Finally, the food arrived, the kids food was delicious  Pancake and bacon waffle (yay- that bacon DID taste good!) We had mentioned that my hubby and I were just splitting the burger because they are enormous - but it was brought out on a single plate (not a big deal, but the nights errors were starting to add up) the busboy brought us a plate and he just sort of flung it in my general direction-(still trying to be polite and smile) I ask for some mayo from our waitress- by the time our waitress came back to see if the busboy brought it - I had already finished my half!  With all this  happening, I was no longer happy, but the kids were happy so we were going with it- as we were wrapping up the we asked the waitress for a ""to go"" box for my daughter's pancake remains and we waited for 17 minutes for her to come back to our table and by time she returned, she had forgotten that we ever asked for it- (seriously, it was 15 feet from our table!) My mood ruined, feeling frustrated and incredibly disappointed in this experience- we get ready to pay, now, here's the thing- as parents of twins a night out a huge deal for us, so we pick our places carefully- I am very sad that this happened, but more needed to be done to recognize that we were the Murphy's LAW table. 

 Although, thoroughly disappointed in the experience we still left a nice tip because we understand how the food service world is, however, I am so saddened that it had to be on a night that was so special and we left deflated. So, it seems that consistency was the issue- why was the first time so wonderful and this time terrible? I've no idea, but we will not return to find out! :(",0,0,0

The clubhouse renovations are finished and looks great. The staff was great and helpful when we had questions.

We were in building 18 in a one bedroom. The room was great. All of the appliances looked new and worked well. The whole place was extremely clean. There was a washer and dryer in a workroom off of the balcony. The balcony had a small table and two chairs.  There was a large TV in the living room and another in the bedroom (we were estimating 42""). They looked new and even had a place to plug in the HDMI cable we brought so we could watch stuff off of our laptop. There was a DVD player in the living room. The free internet worked great. 

There was a shuttle that went to the strip and other places around town. We did not use the shuttle but talked to several people who did and said it was great and ran often. We had our own car but at night when we knew we would be drinking, we just walked to and from the strip. It is behind the Imperial Palace (which is across the street from Ceasars). To walk to the strip you have to walk past an empty dirt lot and then you are in the Imperial Palace parking garage. It isn't ideal, but I felt pretty safe since it is a large dirt lot and there wasn't anywhere for anyone to hide or jump out at you. You would see someone coming from very far away. 

We did get to hang out at the pool for awhile. There are 5 clusters of buildings and each has it's own pool area. Each pool is ""themed"" but there wasn't much difference between them. Ours had an outdoor hot tub and an indoor hot tub. There was a little building with a workout area, the hot tub, and in the women's dressing room\/bathroom there was a sauna. The outdoor pool was heated (this was Nov) and there were people swimming. One of the pool areas has a ""mini-golf"" but it looked like just one hole. Still, it might entertain children for a few minutes. We did not have our kids with us this time so we did not check out the game room, but I know they have one. We did not do any of the activities, but it looked like lots of fun stuff for kids and families to keep busy during the day.

We have stayed at a Wyndham time share in Vegas off of Harmon a couple years ago. It was comparable to this one (although I think this one was better for walking to strip). We would definitely return to either of these - with or without the kids. Very nice stay.",0,0,0

Personally I love their Kung Pao Chicken because they have the most peanuts of any that I have ever had and the brown chile sauce has just the right amount of spice. They serve a decent bowl of Sweet & Sour soup. The Mongolian Beef is a reliable contender. And they have very reasonably priced lunch specials. 

Aside from the food, I have one other criteria for Chinese restaurants... When you are sitting in a booth, the walls should not be covered in little dots of decaying bio-matter. I should not have to guess what rotting sauce is spread across the shell-inlay-ed picture of a woman carrying water over a bridge. Golden Phoenix passes this test. Not to mention that I don't think they have ever made the Dirty Dining report...

Overall, they are a better choice than some of the options in the area and if you are in need of a party spot, they have a reasonably sized private room for such an occassion.",5,4,4

cHQ6dLudmUJyf8b-8PxDfw,-8EnCioUmDygAbsYZmTeRQ,9SU7ZZhaFUJJ6m2k5HKHeg,3,2014-11-22,"SLS, a small boutique hotel with unique and interesting designs, everything is edgy and different from other luxury hotels in Las Vegas. I was actually happy about a new SLS hotel opening in Vegas, and was looking forward to staying here on this trip. We stayed at one of the biggest suites in Lux tower for 3 nights and 4days, tried pretty much all the restaurants and bars here, actually all the places that are opened during our stay, so I think my review is pretty legit in a lot of ways. 

They like drapes, a lot of drapes, on the walls, all over the walls, in the suites, at the spa, everywhere! They don't like bathtubs, NO bathtub in our 955sf SLS king suite at Lux tower? !!! They should change the oversized bath description on their site to oversized dining table about this suite! Seriously, there is only a king bed for 2 people in the bedroom, why on earth would they put a huge dining table for 6 people in the living room? Not to mention the huge couch in living room that can easily fit in 12 thin people, and another couch in bedroom with a small dining table, are we hosting dinner parties in this suite or what?! It's just odd....

Our suite is very spacious with separate living room and bedroom, a guest powder room and a decent sized master bathroom. NO closets at all, just a storage shelve with a few drawers and in-room safe in the bathroom. Did SLS tell Starck to use the minimum cost on remodeling? If they didn't build new closets and bathtubs and walls, the cost must be the lowest for them, the walls were just drapes with pictures on them, that's convenient for sure, just put on drapes all over the walls! It looks like they intended to waste a lot of spaces to make a comfy guest room, hey let's just put the furnitures in and foregt about the rest of the spaces! Easy for them, not so comfy for us hotel guests.... Just saying...

But, I still love Starck's interior design, all whites with popped out pinks, very girly and beautiful, just not very practical, we guests deserve a bathtub for what we pay for a suite! 

Because of the small size of this hotel, there is not much going on here. All fine dining restaurants only open for dinner, even the casual dining Ku noodle only opens for dinner? Comeon! Who eats noodles for dinner? It's for lunch! We stayed for 4 days and ran out of places to eat, especially during the day. And I am never gonna stand in line to order pizzas at that pizza joint, just not gonna happen! Since it's winter, there is only LIFE nightclub, Foxtail pool club is closed for the season, same as the pool, guests can still go there but it's just too cold to hang at the pool area.

A little shopping at Fred Segal, different stores at different wings of the hotel, I got something of course, the selections were not as good as the one in Santa Monica. There are only two bars, Monkey bar and Center bar, they share some same specialty cocktails I noticed. There is a screen above the center bar, it plays 50 images that is so cool to look at! 

The room service was miss and hit, we ordered room service on Friday night but it never came, they still charged to our room? WTH? Ordered room service again on Sunday night, the options were extremely limited as the lady told me on the phone ""it's late night so we don't have that!"" Okay.... just flatbread, omelettes and bottle of champagne with OJ to make mimosa! At least the food was pretty delicious, loved the hash browns.

Overall this is a cute luxury boutique hotel, the Lux tower we stayed at was great, close to the monkey bar, spa \/ gym, and monorail. And it's very private, you need guest keys to get in the elevators. But....will I stay here again? Maybe just maybe for one night, more than that? Very unlikely. The service was disorganized from time to time, not enough restaurants and lounges. Only three fine dining establishments, had to cross out Bazzar meat by Jose Andres cause it sounded like a chamber of horror to me. And above all? NO bathtub in our big suite! It's completely unacceptable!

This hotel just didn't work for me as well as I expected, it's luxury alright, on both prices and servies, but the suite, restaurants and bars just fell a little bit short! 

The rates of regular guest rooms in other towers are very low, because they are very small rooms. So if you are looking for luxury hotel at affordable prices, this hotel might work for you! 

Ps. Depite how much they love drapes, the drapes don't close completely in our suite bedroom, there is a gap... So bad!",15,1,3

Then he told me how terrible the mojito I'd just ordered was going to be, and sighed, as though he was pained to have to serve it without it's requisite stick of sugar cane. (Honestly, it wasn't half bad, and the martinis were great.) He also scolded me for ordering my dessert too early - still not sure what that was all about. Then some other diners showed up in his section - it was nearly deserted that evening - and our less-than gregarious waiter became a Superstar..cracking jokes with the other diners and being generally jovial.

And as much as it kills me to quote my mother, if something seems to good to be true then it usually is. That was definitely the case here. Don't get me wrong, it was nice. But 'nice' also applies to your friend's boring girlfriend, or the jumper your gran gives you at christmas and is desperate to hear your opinion of. 

First off, I think it's really cheeky when restaurants charge you for a basket of bread. Especially when there's only one slice each, it's not even that fresh and it costs £3.50. For that price i could have bought myself a glass of wine, and i know which one of the two i'd have preferred!

We were ordering from the 'Du Vin Or Not Du Vin' menu, which gave us the choice of 2 courses for £10 a head, or 2 courses with wine for £15 a head. At first glance, it all sounded very tasty and exciting... but it was effectively just a list of your bang-average pub dishes described over 4 or 5 lines, with at least half of those words being in various foreign languages.

My boyfriend had steak and chips (which, incidentally, wasn't cooked the way he'd asked for it) and I had mussels and chips in a really bland cream sauce with some green bits in it, although if they were herbs I couldn't taste them... now you understand why they have to dress it up so much on the menu! In the ten days since we ate there, I've completely forgotten what we even had as a starter - read into that what you will.

Long story short, I ended up paying almost £50 for a meal that they make you think will cost £30. More annoyingly, it was a meal that I could have got in pretty much any of the half dozen pubs within 20 metres of here, for a fraction of that price and with much better atmosphere. I don't mind paying a lot when it's actually worth it, but I just got the feeling here that they were trying to get money out of you at every available opportunity, with all their sly little extras.",1,2,0

I'd like for this place to be something.  Right now it feels a lot like a stereotypical 'church' coffee shop.  If this place was rated on food alone, I could up the ante a bit.  I'd call this closer to an American cafe, than a coffee shop - maybe I'm just too snobby.

Some of the baked goods and foods were well done \/ thought out.  Some things left me hanging on a questionable note.  It's my assumption the coffee isn't a major focus here.  So be it.

All that said, I've seen shops go from this to greatness.  Even in the PHX-Metro area, nearly identical shops have gone from this to some of the best in their area.

The words they use for sizes are very poorly calibrated, with their idea of ""small"" being a normal place's idea of ""large."" They do this to upsell you to more food than you need.

I'm a guy, 6'3"", and I've got a big appetite, but their ""little"" burgers are definitely adequate for lunchtime. The ""regular"" burgers, by comparison, are the same as the ""little"" burgers, just with two beef patties instead of one. So in other words, it's totally a marketing thing designed to upsell you to more food than you need. ""Little"" is actually ""regular"", and ""regular"" is actually ""extra large.""

Unfortunately, fries work the same way. The ""regular"" fries are the smallest size on the menu, but they're easily large enough for two people. In other words, the minimum amount of fries you can order is still, in effect, an ""extra large.""

I guess maybe this is just designed as a group place. So if you're a lone diner, be prepared to buy too much food if you really want to get a burger AND fries. If you get a little burger and a regular fries, it's the equivalent of another place's regular burger and extra large fries.

Overall, three stars, because the food really is very good. It's just a shame they have a deceptive sizing\/price structure.",3,0,0

Yelp came to the rescue and I saw the Nacho Daddy was within the Miracle Mile which is connected to the Elara. It feels like you're exiting the property which you are but when you turn right, the establishment is right there close to - couple yards from the intersection of Las Vegas Blvd. If you sit outside you can hear and see a lot of the hustle of the strip. 

Nachos were really good, I was happy to see all the vegetarian options. I would have liked my nachos to be more cheesy. They were perfectly spiced however and the flavors all melded very well. Huge portions and so two people can easily share. I had a peach margarita along with my meal which was quite strong but good. I was happy with the prospect that I could take it to go as I had an early morning but still wanted to enjoy it back in my room. They had live music while I was there and it was a fun little joint to enjoy when you sort of just want to get away from what is the strip. Will defiantly be back when in Vegas.

Mike at Riley's is not only fair and honest, he's reliable, and allot more fair in pricing than most others. Another big plus, at least to me, he is friendly and possess good customer service skills. 
I had him out at my residence recently for a couple of major pool repairs and couldn't be more satisfied. He arrives at the the time agreed upon, his work is right on and efficiently completed in a short amount of time. He answered all of my questions and offered advice when noted. 
I read reviews where some people are big on time to complete work or waiting time. Everyone's got there own but mine is being honest with me and quality of work. Mike has those covered with no problem as well as all the other required boxes checked off.

Like the author of the above piece, I too enjoyed the decor, although I didn't pay much attention to the pictures on the wall. 

Kay wanted Asian food Friday evening, and when Kay wants Asian food, she gets Asian food, so to Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh's current Asian cuisine hotbed, we went. 

The word ""authentic"" is one I keep seeing  in many reviews of Ka Mei and ethnic restaurants in general. I'll say as I have said in the past that I really don't know much about ethnic authenticity and have learned to care less and less about it over time. To me, If it's good, it's good, and from my gustatory perspective, Ka Mei's food was just acceptable.

It's funny how Chinese food has become so commonplace in my life. What were once exotic delicacies have now become as traditional as spaghetti to me.  Consequently, when I go to Chinese restaurants these days, I find myself at a loss regarding what to order, so on this evening I chose my meal at random. 

Crab Rangoon's usually a safe bet for me, but Ka Mei's take was a little disappointing on my end. We ordered it for our appetizer and were slightly let down by its waterly, nearly crabless filling and the somewhat tough wonton that held it. 

My Kung Pao Shrimp was loaded with bright, thickly chopped veggies and was not without an ample helping of portly, juicy shrimp. Something was missing, however. Aside from being sufficiently spicy, I felt the dish was deficient in savoriness. The portion was rather hearty, yet I had to force myself to finish it despite arriving with an angry stomach. It was passable, I suppose, but it failed to excite me enough to devour it in my usual ravenous fashion. 

Methinks I need to institute a personal moratorium on Chinese food. Am I gettin' burned out on it? Is fatigue to blame for me being underwhelmed by Ka Mei?",6,6,7

We chose to stay here for a wedding and blocked a cluster of rooms (10+) about 4 months in advance. When we arrived, our rooms weren't ready. We arranged for early check-in and had several members of our party waiting for hours to get checked in. I personally did not get into my room until after 5:00pm even though standard check-in time is 3:00. I booked a suite and they kept telling me to come back to the desk to see if it was ready. Mind you we arrived at 10:00am. I suggested they call me when it was ready since I had to keep waiting for hours. They said they didn't usually do that. They called me 3 times to tell me my check-in was being delayed because the current occupant kept requesting a later check out. The customer service to handle the matter was not accommodating. One of the people staying with us even found bed bugs in their room!!! This was highly upsetting considering the status of the hotel. We brought a lot of business to the hotel for a wedding and our guests rooms were not ready upon arrival. 

Once we got to our suite it stunk! We had to call someone to come spray a deodorizing spray. We called down to the front desk and someone came up within 45 minutes to fix it. That worked!  The wall plugs did not work to charge our phones, they kept ""spitting"" them out. The convenience USB portals on the TV stand didn't work either. 
Wi-fi connection was very weak. We couldn't stay connected even while sitting in our room.

Avenue Café - Staff was accommodating and friendly! Food was delicious and exceeded what I thought it would be. This was our last meal in the hotel and it was great!

I went with my Dad, who was in town for the day. Bonus points for having a few plasmas playing the ballgame, but not too many. Classy and understated all the way. New Mexico themed fare, whatever that is. It is basically a seafood\/steakhouse with a bit of extra spicy kick to everything. I went with the Pasta and Grill, which consisted of a small medallion of steak, some chicken (with the added kick) and swordfish with a spicy chutney over the top. Served over beans and rice, with half the plate offering up some pretty damned tasty penne. Went great with a glass of wine, and not too much damage on the wallet. We got out of there for $60 plus a tip. One of my new favorites.

Most of the time I've shown pics to the nail tech of the general look of what I would like. Easy stuff, usually just complimentary colors on different nails- not even any designs or anything. The times I've been in before the nail techs have given guidance, explaining to me what colors would work best that they have or what would look best on my skin tone. I appreciate their input because they know far more about this subject than I do & it makes me feel more confident than sifting through rings & rings of polish & then hoping my vision comes to fruition. 

On my last visit, I'm pretty sure I was being helped by the main lady in charge. I showed her a design I wanted, two shades of purple & a glitter silver. She looked, grabbed the silver & then tossed me the box of colors saying ""no you have to choose"" after a minute of looking & trying not to waste her time I brought her two colors & asked if she thought they were complimentary colors & similar to the design I showed her. She shook her head & said she wouldn't help me because she didn't want to hear about it if I didn't like it in the end. While I semi-understand her sentiment about not wanting to be responsible if I don't like it, I feel like if someone is asking for your professional opinion you should try to help them. It's not like I was just asking her to pick any random color for me, I was asking her to help me achieve a look. She had just began to take off my polish with the nail file, as I continued to paw through the colors- not finding a large variety & thus giving me no confidence that this would even look decent. I started to panic about finding what I needed in time & then I froze. Before she could pick up my second finger, I slid my hand away & realized that I didn't want to pay $30+ tip for something that I wasn't sure about & that I didn't want to sit there for the next 30 mins feeling like an annoyance to someone. 
There are nail salons on every corner. I literally drove to the next intersection, walked into another salon (az tips & toes) & got exactly what I had hoped to get when I originally set foot into bamboo, which was friendly service & a little bit of help. I showed the girl the pic & asked if she could do it & she said ""no problem, I'll get those colors for you right now"". It's really that simple. 
I had been going to bamboo nails because I tried it on a whim once & was happy with their work. I try not to require too much & the service was friendly enough & the atmosphere is nice too. I would have stayed a loyal customer if they had not made me feel like an annoyance & an idiot for seeking assistance. Every time I have gone in there it has been virtually empty, with the staff members sitting around chatting so it's very hard for me to understand why they (or any company) would be so flippant about keeping a moderate level of customer service. 
I'm giving this company one star because if an interaction at an establishment that I previously fully intended to give my money to causes me to walk out due to rudeness & general apathy, then what good is it serving?",4,0,0

He picked 32 Degree Draft Bar at The M. And it was a good call.

As everyone has noted, they have a massive beer selection with 96 different taps running. Since this is a sports book in a Vegas casino, yes, some of those taps are naturally reserved for commoner beer to suit those with a taste for garbage beer. And some of those are reserved for the ""standard"" mega-craft brews (Blue Moon, Sam Adams) and big name imports (Guinness, Harp, Dos Equis, Heineken, Stella, etc.) for the less adventurous types. And admittedly, I did chuckle when the menu went into a detailed description of EVERY beer. (I don't think we need a description of Michelob Ultra, thankyoumuch.) The American craft brew selection leaned more towards west-coast breweries, and was a bit IPA heavy, and the imports were the more familiar names, with a few nice Belgian selections found within.

Overall, I preferred the import selection a bit more, and there were some nice finds amongst the mix. One was from an Imperial Stout from the exceptional New Zealand brewery Moa, and another was a personal favorite from the UK, Old Speckled Hen. They do keep a fairly up to date list on The M's website, so beer snobs may want to check it first to see if it is worth it to visit based upon your preferences. 

I only had the two beers here, no food. But they offer food that appears to come from the Vig Deli within the M, so reviewing them just on the beer selection is valid IMO. And it was pretty much what I expected here - a lot of standards with a few hidden gems mixed in. If I were ""beer hunting"" I would look for better options in town. But if I were looking to watch a game (or bet on one) and have some strong beer options on tap while doing so, I'd definitely come back.",1,0,1

Unfortunately I won't be returning as I ended up having the worst (& most expensive) colour I have had in my life as well as a less-than-impressive trim. 

I had had a colour correction consultation appointment a week prior to the actual appointment, and was told that what I wanted was doable. 

I was going from a super dark cool toned box-dyed brown to my natural colour, a medium ash brown. I emphasized my want for a natural look and showed pictures of what I was going for, but ultimately walked out with a patchy bright red with dark brown streaks.

My bangs were noticeably darker than the rest of my hair and the stylist offered to fix it for no extra charge in a follow-up appointment. That was polite & all, however, I couldn't get a follow-up appointment until a week later and so I walked around with crazy-looking hair and puzzled looks from friends & acquaintances for a week packed with presentations and meetings. As you can imagine, I was less than thrilled - especially after dropping $300. 

Today, about two months later, I finally had my hair fixed to the medium ash brown I had desired months ago at another salon outside of Toronto. I explained to today's stylist what my Cabinet stylist had done & how he had done it and she was shocked. The Cabinet stylist used bleach in patches (as though he were highlighting my hair) to lift my colour, whereas today's stylist used an all-over colour correction cream. She also said she noticed ""holes"" my cut, which admittedly, I hadn't noticed prior to her mentioning. 

I definitely won't be back. Though the vibe of the salon is great, the location is convenient & the stylists are friendly, my hair - what really matters - was a mess, even at such a high price point.",2,0,1

The lobby is clean and well kept but looks outdated. The rooms were nice looking and the bed was comfy.  Unfortunately the walls are paper thin and our bathroom door was broken. Once closed you had to pull on the handle with tremendous efforts to get it to open again...the boyfriend had a mild heart attack thinking he was stuck there. I laughed at the rubber mat they left rolled up in the corner of the tub. So 80's and unwelcoming; these things attract bacteria and mildew like there's no tomorrow. I fully understood why they had when I took a shower; the tub was extremely slippery! Keeping with the restroom theme, the shampoo and conditioner were simply one of the worst I've used. The product inside itself isn't bad. They're supplied by bath and body works and to be fair my hair felt and looked nice afterwards. The problem is in the bottle themselves. It's ridiculously hard to get the product out of there. You get one good gulp and then nothing, so much waste. 

Moving on to the service part of my stay. We were welcomed by a male employee who was courteous but had very visible tattoos on his hands. Call me old fashioned but it threw me off a little bit, like a mismatch between the look of the employee and the setting. They took a deposit on my credit card without warning me. Although it was corrected at check out I would have appreciated them telling me rather than my credit company sending me an email alert for the latest transactions and finding it out from there. 

I can understand why people chose to come here as it is not too far from the airport but for the price I think the Hilton Garden Inn is much nicer and has better service. The only 2 parts that I could give 5 stars are the pool and the banquet hall. The pool is perfect if you're travelling with kids, it has this huge water slide that will keep them entertain. As a montrealer I think you can book the pool for events or kids birthday party. The banquet hall was stellar! The food was delicious and the rooms were beautiful as well maintained.

I am a young mom of two children a 2 year old boy and 2 month old girl. This was not my first time at twirl (the yogurt is actually very good there). However, the last time I went my experience of awful with the service. 

That day It was only my children and I getting yogurt. As I started to dispense my toddlers yogurt, he urgently asked me to pick him up and when I did he threw up EVERYWHERE! My son and I were literally drenched in chunks of throw up and it was also all over the ground. It was so bad that I was forced to I throw away my sons clothes and my shirt.. leaving me only in my sports bar. At this point I was completely stressed out, since my son suddenly got sick out of no where and we were an absolute mess. I felt terrible for my little guy; my son was extremely scared too and began to cry since he was sick and covered in throw up and my baby also started to get fussy. 

The lady behind the counter hands my a pile of towels and brings out a mop asking me to clean the chunks with the towels and that she would mop it after (which is fine since I didn't want to leave a 17 year old to clean it up). But I was still completely mortified as I was trying to tend to my son and now fussy daughter. Now at this point I am on my hands and knees trying to clean up all the vomit as quickly as possible so I could get my sick toddler and baby home (and don't forget I have a sick toddler crying, covered in throw up, only in a diaper, and fussing infant in a stroller while I am doing this). 

As I finally finished cleaning the throw up I rushed my children out the door and begin to load up the car as quickly as possible so I could get my sick son home to shower both him and myself. 

As I just got my screaming toddler and baby finally in their car seats and the stroller and diaper bag loaded in the trunk, I notice that the same 17 year old girl working behind the counter racing to my car saying I needed to pay for the yogurt I dispensed. The yogurt was left still under the yogurt dispenser right before the throw up incident happened! 

I was completely in shambles at this point and I actually just got in my car and left without a word. 

I can't believe after such a terrifying event for myself and toddler she had the nerve to come to my car and say I needed to come back inside and pay for the maybe two dollars worth of yogurt in the cup. 

I could of easily left when my toddler threw up, but I didn't. Instead I stayed and cleaned when I clearly needed to get my son home right away. 

When my husband heard about the event he wanted to call the next day to the owner.. that is how upset he was, but I said I would write a review instead. 

I was very disappointed. As a fellow resident in the area I will not becoming back. Other family members and neighborhood friends have also stated they would not be going there either after hearing this story.",0,0,0

To a kid, that sounds like an awesome breakfast!

Unfortunately, they don't do ""breakfast"" here....they only do ""brunch"".  After coming here, I've learned brunch is defined as: we're going to call breakfast something different so we can charge you $20.00 per person to eat here, $12.00 per little person, oh, and if you're child is over 3 years old, despite the fact they can only fit a fistful of food in their tummy, you're paying $12.00 too. 

Also, they automatically add a $3.00 tip to your bill, so you SHOULD know that (though Circus Circus doesn't think you should, because they won't display that anywhere, or tell you).  

Ugh......

The kids weren't impressed.  Not only was the buffet not ""circus themed"" (other than a few abstract paintings on the wall), the food wasn't good at all.  The eggs were overly runny, the spaghetti was about as good as the canned stuff (my kids are used to homemade), the menudo was all tripe....the kids didn't like anything except for their bowl of yogurt.  No joke. 

I thought everything I ate was ""OK"" at best.  Nothing incredible.  Nothing to be excited for. NOTHING to pay $20.00 for. 

The staff here are all very rude as well.  After reading an (apparently old Vegas blog post, despite being written in July of this year), I asked why my four year old was charged for entry, when I thought 4 and younger were free.  The cashier said, ""Not any more. It's over 3, so she's paying"". I don't know why she thought my daughter would pay, being that she's currently of non-working or wage earning age, but, whatever.  When I asked one of the cooks if they had mac n' cheese today (again, blog post said kids love it), the cook said, ""No"" and walked away.

Maybe if the casino left the tipping up to the individual, rather than sticking you for $3.00 upon entry, the staff would be friendlier, trying to earn tips??? Just a thought. 

Oh well, I won't know, because I'll never come here again.",3,3,2

Really a fantastic meal and amazing restaurant, everything from service, food, presentation, wine list, design and view are top notch.  The foursome I was with were so impressed we made a 2nd reservation as we were walking out to return in a few months when Chef Gagnaire is supposedly going to be in town and actually in the kitchen.  My first three star Michelin chef experience was even better than I expected.

We decided to go the a la carte route so we could share and try more things.  I could tell the direction this was going right from the start with the amuse bouche that included 6 different tastings.  Favorites here were the Tuna Mousse served with a rice based cracker and these irish jello shots (i can't recall what they were actually called but that is the best description I can come up)

Appetizers that stood out for me was the Lagostines served 5 ways and the scallops served 3 ways.  I ordered the veal but unfortunately they had run out, which in retrospect makes even me surprised I'm still willing to give Twist 5 stars.  The Lamb served three ways though made me quickly forget about the lack of veal.  This included a perfectly cooked lamb chop and a fantastic lamb shoulder dumpling.

Two at our table ordered the Rib Eye which was served two ways.  The grilled rib eye was great, but the 2nd plate of rib eye tips was a bit disappointing to some of us.  Another ordered the halibut which was probably my favorite of all the main courses.

For desert the souffle was amazing.

Overall the food here is fantastic, with incredible presentation.  The variety of techniques and presentation used is quite impressive.  I highly suggest to anyone looking for a special occasion type restaurant in Vegas or if you just feel like splurging on a great meal.",2,1,1

They didn't even have enough beef for the three sandwiches I ordered; we had to wait. Overall, the food was just not that good. Service was ""meh"". It was a pickup and we took it to work. 

The beef was just bland - entirely unseasoned and so insanely dry despite the sauce. Asked for the ""gravy"" on the side, ended up with a sopping bun, leaking bag, and an extra charge for a side gravy instead. The other bun was hard and soaked in grease (not gravy - actual grease). The peppers were very tasty, but they tore up my co-workers stomach. She's not really a lightweight with her spicy foods, and even then she only asked for sweet peppers, not hot. I came out unscathed, luckily. 

I'm not sure how this is considered Chicago beef. It's not at all juicy, flavorful, or spicy. It's just bland, messy, soggy, and rather unappealing. Perhaps I'm just spoiled after our little discovery during San Gennaro? A little booth at the fair called ""Gina's Italian Beef"". Amazing.

My friends and I got in Friday night to the Cosmopolitan.  We were pretty excited because the Cosmo is a fancy hotel and we had heard their night club was fun.
We went to Marquee for a couple hours and then decided to go gamble.  I left my friends so I could go use the restroom.  Well you know how you can easily get turned around in a casino.  I was wondering around by myself for a hot minute trying to find my friends.  A security agent approached me asking to see my ID.  Not a problem at all.  I gave it to him and made a joke about how he made my night because I'm 30.  He completely ignores me and starts saying my name into his radio.  Thinking that he'd only wanted to see my ID to verify age, I asked him what was going on.  He held up his hand and shushed me.  Well I'm sorry but I'm a grown women staying at your hotel and you've taken my ID and aren't giving me any details.  This has now upset me.  I ask him again what's going on and he continues to talk into his radio.  I tell him I want my id back and he tells me I need to calm down.   Still not explaining to me what's going on.  I told him I was staying at hotel and he asked my room number.  I left one number off on accident and he tells me I'm lying bc that's not even a room there.  He then tells me I have to leave.  He walks my outside and tells me to leave.  Well at this point I'm a little frantic because my friends are inside and I'm being kicked out of the hotel FOR NO REASON!!!!  I come straight back inside and so they call metro police on me.  A gang unit.  Yes a single female staying at Cosmo with some friends had a gang unit called on her FOR NO REASON!  I'm being argued with and held and still no one is telling me what I have done wrong.  Finally the shift manager from security comes and pulls me aside and speaks to me in much more respectful manor.  He explains it's protocol to stop people that might be part of ""suspicious activity"".  Yes, that's right I was being confused for an escort.  I paid for an expensive room at The Cosmopolitan only to be held for 15 minutes because I could possibly be taking part in suspicious activity as I walk around lost looking for my friends.  Well needless to say I am beyond upset at this point.  They finally check to see that my name is in their system as being a guest.  Couldn't they have done that within first 5 minutes and avoided all this?  Avoided offending and embarrassing me in front  people in the casino watching the whole debacle take place!  I get to leave finally and return to my friends.  The next day we go straight to the security office to file a complaint.  We thought for sure the Cosmopolitan would be very apologetic and quite frankly embarrassed that their security treated a guest this way.  Not at all!  I barely got an apology.  I was informed I can email risk management and that could take up to two weeks to hear back.  We then decided to go to guest services.  Surely someone on their staff is going to want to rectify this situation.  Surely The Cosmopolitan isn't ok with treating guest this way.  Haha wow was I wrong.  The senior manager at guest services was condescending and rude.  He implied that it was my fault.  Saying that ""metro police had a negative experience with me.""  Ya think?  You held me without reason for 15 minutes in the assumption I was an escort!  Most people would be livid!  I spoke with 4 different departments at the Cosmopolitan and no one was helpful.   It seems this is standard for them.  Unless you want to risk being harassed by security, I would stay far far away from The Cosmopolitan.  There are plenty of wonderful hotels on the strip that treat their guest with respect.

The owner Patrick is a super nice guy who seems to genuinely care about everyone who walks in and ensuring they have a good time.  He even hosts an orphan Christmas dinner where he puts on a big feed and welcomes everyone in, especially those without family to share the holidays with.  

There are affordable daily specials and the bands on the weekend are actually good!  They are happy to have your kids in with you during the day and everyone from their 20's right through goes in, everyone is welcome.

Indeed, it has old school metal lamps hung from its cord, concrete looking wallpaper and decor. Barley tea is poured into metal tin cups. At one time these were probably items used by the poor or soldiers but now they are trendy. I was told by my friend who frequents the place that this concept originally came from LA....much like most restaurants in Vegas. I think the only thing original in Vegas is the sand that blows outside.

The service was not bad. They forgot my BBbap for a good 30-40 minutes before we stopped conversing and wondering where the food was besides the Hite beer my friend was imbibing. I much liked the barley drink so I was on bottle #2 by then. The waiter professed not to have heard me even though he repeated what I said when he took our orders. That's fine. Mistakes happen so we weren't fussing over it. Besides, neither one of us is a rotund Kardashian who would break a nail at such an outrage. Oops, I think I wrote aloud on that one.

They brought out the sides and I munched on that and had them refill 2 of them before my entree came out. The food did come out 10 minutes later. While the dish was traditional, the taste wasn't. Missing was the aroma and flavor of the burnt rice crust on the bottom of the earthen pot\/bowl. And that my friends is how you make 10 minute bimbimbapp. The egg and toppings were meh.

BBP was one of my first introductions to korean food. Before Vegas grew, the commercial center was where you find Korean restaurants and the only K restaurant down there that was great was Jinme. I didn't know you were supposed to mix the bowl up before eating. The owner\/server saw me and exasperatedly said , ""ahhhh, if I had time I would show you how to eat this"" and hurriedly mixed it up for me before rushing to the next table. So from there on, I mix my BBP like a non-Korean guy would, gingerly.

My friend, who is Korean, told me that it's a very good eatery. I'll take his word for it because he's a pretty fastidious eater. I patronize oxtail soups in the California and Fremont Hotels so my style is no style, as long as it tastes good.

We went at 12:30am and we stayed until 2:20 toward closing time of 2:30. There were quite a few of us still in there toward the end. So, while I didn't care for my food much, it's a pretty popular place. Like any respectable trendy K spot, there were 2 groups of guys puffing smokes and vapes outside the restaurant as we walked to the car.

Paying my bill at the register I noticed on the wall huge chalkboard wall, a drink they dubbed the beergarita. I guess besides the war cantina look, they outsmarted Mexican restaurants and bottled the margarita. And they say the land of Samsung doesn't innovate. Pish posh.",0,2,1

I bought my first firearm here when I was 19 (Ruger 10\/22 Carbine) and I still have it.  I used to come here with my friend, Russ, quite a bit back in the day.  He got me into the shooting hobby.  At the time, this was the only indoor range that allowed you to shoot high powered rifles since the backstop here can take the abuse.  A lot of places would only allow .22 rifles.  I think most of the ranges nowadays allow high caliber rifles though.

The store has a good variety of firearms at great prices compared to big box stores.  They carry all makes.  The remodeled shooting range is so much better than what it used to be.  My recent visit was the first time coming here since the remodel.  In addition to the range, the entire store layout was changed and I think it looks great!  They even have a little ""waiting room"" area with couches for when the wait time for the range gets long.  The bathrooms are handy for washing the lead residue off your hands when you're done shooting.  I'm kinda OCD about having clean hands...haha

The employees who work there are very knowledgeable, but as other Yelpers have mentioned, they can be a bit weird with their tough guy personas sometimes.  It doesn't bother me though.  Since I live pretty far away from Stonewall, I probably won't be making it up here very often unless my brother or my Romanian buddy want to shoot their ARs.

Come check out Stonewall if you're in the area!  Great prices and nice selection of firearms and knives and oh, the lovely range!",4,1,2

Now to the real review:

The restaurant looks nice and the staff are fast and friendly. but they seem to forget little things. My husband got some sushi, and with it, came the usual pickled ginger, but no wasabi. Hmm... No big deal. Our drinks weren't refilled either without us asking. The food however was quite tasty and beautifully plated and also didn't take too long to come out of the kitchen.

Firstly, I'm Sauga born and bred. Therefore, it takes quite a bit to get me to go downtown, particularly during the winter because traveling is always a major hassle. Alas, I was headed to a friend's birthday party so I went along.

Now, I've been to Earls in Mississauga @ Sq1 before and I've never had a problem. It's not my absolute favourite place to grab a bite but I've always had good service and have been attended to quickly.

We went to this particular Earls on King Street last Saturday for a birthday party (as mentioned). There were roughly 12 of us, and my friend had made reservations several days prior to ensure we would have a table.

When we arrived (on time might I add!) we were told they couldn't find anyone with her name for the 9:30 reservation, despite her having confirmed the day before with the restaurant that she would still require the reservation. This is obviously not what you want to hear on a cold night after having traveled from a different city. It took over 10 minutes with the manager involved to finally figure out that WAS our reservation, but whoever had taken it had put the name down wrong.

Great! Then, we were told the tables weren't ready yet so to please give them about 15 minutes to set everything up. Fine. They brought out some small apps for us to munch on while we waited. Over 30 MINUTES LATER, we were told they weren't quite ready yet but decided to place us at a high table instead so as to not make us wait any longer. Now, if we made reservations and we were on time, why weren't these tables ready?

Fast forward to us sitting down and getting ready to order, that was another mess in itself. Our waitress took half the table's orders but not the other half. How does that work? The birthday girl had to stop her and tell her I hadn't been asked my order yet because 11\/12 people had gotten their food and had started eating meanwhile my order hadn't even been taken yet!

I ordered the birthday girl a Long Island and 20 minutes later nothing had come. I had to stop the waitress again and remind her I had ordered a drink for it to finally come out.

I normally bite my tongue because I really hate making complaints against restaurants seeing as staff are always busy and I'm sure tired by the end of the day. But seriously this was probably one of my worst dining experiences ever and I left feeling like it was a terrible waste of money + trip. I really shouldn't have tipped but I felt bad for the girl so I did anyway.

There's no way I'm ever coming downtown to eat here again! I learned the first time.",2,1,0

At first glance, this restaurant is stunning -- sweeping glass walls, interesting architectural features, intimate booths -- the Aria Café is a sight to behold. Which, kind of, told me that service and the food would match the settings. It took a few minutes to get drinks, which was forgivable, but it took even more time to get a hold of a real waiter to take our food order. Drinks were overpriced -- they're not on the menu, so be advised that sodas are $5. Stick with water if you're going to drink anything -- and the menu itself sits around $18 a plate, so get ready to shell out $42 for an appetizer and an entrée. 

On to the actual meal: The loaded tater tots were the highlight of the evening. It was chock full of lovely green onions, a nice mild cheese sauce, and thickly cut chunks of bacon. However, everything went downhill from there.  I ordered the croissant & egg sandwich with cheese, my friend ordered it without. She didn't like her sandwich much. With cheese was substantially better, but the sandwich itself wasn't great. It wasn't worth the $18 price tag, and to top it off, I almost choked inhaling the flakes off the croissant. Not a good way to start the meal. Another member of our party ordered the chicken sandwich, which was incredibly acidic and tasted almost completely like a pickle, and she wasn't able to finish it -- completely and totally unacceptable. Also, in her words, the ""potato salad tastes like soap"". 

Service was good, but wasn't very quick. The manager was kind enough to remove the check, and they might have been understaffed. However, the food was frankly inadmissible for the price. You can definitely miss the Aria Café -- you'll find far better options worth the price just a few steps away.",2,2,0

My wife loved the Lobster Bisque.  She thought the cup wouldn't be enough so she had the bowl and it was so big I had to help her finish it.  I had the Cesar Salad with a Lobster tail chopped up on top.  It was delicious.  The lobster was incredibly fresh and tasty. We should have just stopped there but also each had the cold Lobster Roll.  Really big chunks of fresh lobster that overflowed from the top of the roll.  My suggestion to the owners\/chefs would be to actually dig out a chunk of the bread in the roll instead of just cutting it in half so that the lobster would fill the roll for each amazing bite instead of overflowing from it.

The Cameron's ale that we had it with (a brewery in Oakville) was very nice as well.
Smoked & Cracked try to use local ingredients and businesses whenever possible which is something I like to support.

We had a couple of small butter tarts to go and we had them on the Sunday.  They were gooey, sweet and the pastry was delicious unlike the cheap flaky ones from supermarket bakeries.

The total bill including tax and tip was just over $100, so it was a bargain for lobster this plentiful and fresh.

Just a note, that when we were leaving around 6:00 p.m., ALL of the tables in the place were now reserved for dinner for the rest of the night.

I felt like deep dish pizza and heard that North End puts out a good one. Walking inside we were greeted and told to sit anywhere. Looking around there were many pictures on the wall of movie posters and different sporting events as well family history of the owner and her family. A lot of Boston decor! The owner, Claudia, was there at a table not only eating, but saying hello to each customer and making sure they were enjoying their food. Claudia has her dad make the pizza dough at his restaurant in Boston, and then ships it to Las Vegas for use here at North End Pizza. Her mom makes the pizza sauce locally from her secret recipe.  

We started out with an order of ""Garlic Knots"" priced at $6.50 for an order of 12 knots and sauce. These weren't traditional since they were *not* in a *knot*, but more a disc if flavorless dough. With all of the seasoning on them, I didn't get it and would not order them again, knowing where I can get authentic ones at other restaurants in town. 

For the main course I ordered a ""1\/2 Ricotta & Garlic 1\/2 Sausage Pizza"" priced at  $22.99 including toppings. I ordered the Sicilian, which requires an hour for prep\/bake time. If you know you want this then you can just call ahead and have them start it for you. The Sicilian only comes in 16 inch size. I really enjoyed this pizza! I tasted nothing but garlic on my half so I don't know where the garlic flavor was on the knots? The pizza dough was nice and thick and cooked thoroughly. We had more then enough left to take home for another meal! I want to come back and try their thin crust pizza next.

You can come in and buy pizza by the slice or try out some of their calzones, pasta, salads, sandwiches or appetizers. North End offers delivery\/dine-in\/carryout.

The birthday girl goes to the corner of the bar and tries to get a drink while three of the girls head upstairs to get their groove on. I looked over to see someone up in the birthday girl's face and I tagged one of the other girls and the other girl looked over ... IT WAS ON!

I've enthusiastically consumed both lunch and dinner here, so can attest to the fact the food is ace, along with the cocktail menu, which is pretty snazz too.

Fishcakes, always good. Caesar salad, the classic lunchtime favourite, also never a letdown. The rib-eye steak and frites, also the target of a good wolfing down in the past. Nothing on the menu here has ever offended me, or has really ever been bad, in simple terms.

The combo is filling enough for a lunch meal. However, if you are really hungry, get the full soup (which comes with a delicious looking biscuit) and split a wrap with someone.

To start, I am by no means a steak enthusiast, so I can't do a proper critique of a place that distinguishes and prides itself as a steakhouse\/butchery. That would be the equivalent of a non-drinking designated driver hitting up the bar and reviewing a Shirley Temple, while all his\/her friends got progressively drunk. This is why my star-rating is a little skewed. 

I'll tell you what I did have though: PORTOBELLO FRIES with HERB AIOLI ($9.80). Believe the hype! They're incredible. Huge slices of mushrooms, crunchy on the outside perfected with a delicate balance of melt-in-your-mouth goodness on the inside. Worth it. I also had a side of Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes with White Cheddar ($5.90) and indulged in The Seascape cocktail ($9.80) -- Ketel vodka, fruity yet potent. My friends had ordered side dishes too, and we just did a family-style thing where we'd try each other's selections. 

Service was great. We walked in on a Monday afternoon without reservations and were immediately seated upstairs. The interior was not too packed, but had to wait a little while before our waiter took our food order. Overall, an upscale and well-managed restaurant, but it's not really somewhere I'd frequently visit.

I came to the South Side incarnation with a date 6 years ago in an attempt to escape an early May heatwave. An expensive phosphate beverage rinsed my throat of an arid panini that took far too long to reach my table. Service was provided by a duo of detached, indolent hipsters. 

However, today, I'm forgiving them for a sole reason: The Beehive provides quiet, eclectic refuge for those who are stranded on Carson Street on an insane Saturday night and refuse to booze it up in any of the infinite bars that infest the area.

I didn't care that my brownie (brought in from elsewhere according to the...barista?) was a tad stale. The purposely chintzy interiors, which looks to have been decorated by Fred Schneider of the B-52's after ransacking my deceased grandmother's kitchen and living room, only amused me as did the attention-seeking, pink-haired patrons who were trying very hard to appear self-absorbed or engrossed in whatever they were looking at on their laptop computers. The graffiti that overwhelmed the bathroom walls made me chuckle whenever I wasn't reading something bigoted and hateful, which thankfully was outnumbered more than sufficiently by the witty and the blithe. 

The ennui of the heavily-inked gal bothered me not a bit, either. I'm sure it is boring to work at the Beehive during a time of the week when people party stupidly, and for that, she should be thankful. Knowing what I know, I would be.

Cons: I haven't had my hair in even a month and my braids are loose, EXTREMELY loose. Some of the tracks don't even feel attached to much of anything .

We ordered all specialty rolls and the food was excellent.  The service was pretty fast but then again there were only like 4 other people there.  I still left full and spent less than I did having AYCE at Oyishi a few weeks earlier which was much less impressive.  
I would certainly suggest Sumo if you are looking to go for an ala carte meal.",0,0,0

It's right on the corner of 10th Street & Roosevelt in a cute little red and white dining car.  There are a few parking spaces behind the diner on 10th Street.  I would check the hours, as I think I was told differently than the hours posted in the other review.

My friend and I went to the diner on a Saturday afternoon and were able to get seats inside at the tiny counter.  I'm sure as it gets warmer, those will be harder to come by and that when the weather is nice, most people sit outside.  It is indeed a tiny space on the inside and half the seats have a direct view into the kitchen area, which is kind of homey.  I'm pretty small, so the size inside wasn't an issue for me, but claustrophobes and bigger people might feel squished.

I ordered a hamburger and fries and my friend got an egg sandwich.  The burger was pretty good, but relatively small in comparison to what's generally served at restaurants.  If you're really hungry or a big eater, you'll probably want to go for the double burger.  The fries were good - nice and crisp.  My friend was pretty happy with her egg sandwich but unhappy with her cup of water, which was apparently pretty bad even for tap water.  They have a bunch of organic sodas, along with Coke and Diet Coke, if you're like me and can't wash down a burger and fries with anything but a carbonated beverage.

Overall, I thought it was a pretty cool place and will definitely return with more friends in tow.  (Possibly for one of their movie nights...movies + tasty food = a good time).  Bonus points for their helping with the downtown rejuvenation while also supporting local businesses (Schreiner's, Mary Coyle's).",4,2,3

It lacked chunks of lobster that is traditionally found in bisques and had very little lobster present.  The sandwich was generously portioned with large scallops,  but the roumalaid overpowered the sandwich.  Further,  with such large scallops,  it ate more like a lobster roll rather than a sandwich.

Granted, I went on a Saturday morning which is going to be the busiest time for any restaurant specializing in breakfast, but I do not detract any points for the 30 minutes I had to wait on line for a table. What was irksome was having to wait another 40 minutes after being seated to be served. I ordered the steak and eggs with coffee. When it was finally served 40 minutes later, the waitress had completely forgotten about my coffee. The steak looked good on the outside, but was very gristley and deeply infused with cracked pepper. I happen to like spicy food and was starving so I ate it anyway, but many would not have been able to eat it at all. I didn't make any complaints to the harried teeny bopper waitress as she was just a nervous little cog in this machine who couldn't change a thing. The meal came with bland hash browns and an English muffin. They don't ask you what kind of bread you'd like and whether you want it buttered or not. You are essentially ISSUED an English muffin! The steak and eggs are MUCH better at Denny's, where you get your choice of bread and sides and some individualized attention. Considering the price difference, how depressing is that? 

If only Arizonans could eat in a typical Greek Diner in the northeast or mid-Atlantic US where I come from and see what it's like to eat in a restaurant that puts a little soul and enthusiasm into making and serving simple meals like steak and eggs, they would know what an anemic utilitarian ripoff they're getting in places like U.S. Egg.",4,1,2

The service is great, the resturant is beautiful, but more importantly the food is passionate and inspired. Everything I had was great. I started with a gin drink called the seer. Light refreshing and a good kick. Then I got the squash blossoms as an app. Light almost a tempura style batter stuffed with cheese and seved on a nice tomato chutney or salsa. The waiter asked to take my plate but I shut him down. I used the home made bread to sop up all the flavors from the bottom of the bowl. Next I ordered a nice clean but not too fruity hefeweisen from Vancouver bc. I love wheat beer and this is right up there with the best. For my first course I ordered the lyonnaise salad. This was a bit unsuspected in that I didn't read the menu all the way through. I expected some form of lettuce. But once I took a bite of the light vinaigrette frisée with the egg and chunk of bacon it was the perfect bite. Lastly for my entree I ordered the lamb three ways. The chop was amazing, cooked perfectly and well seasoned. I actually asked for salt but did not need it;-) now the star of the show was this perfectly cooked and seasoned sausage. Juicy and oozing with flavor. When my wife saw my face while taking my first bite she asked me if I was having an orgasm... I did. I keep thinking about how amazing this was I am going to make sausage this week just to see if I can get close to what I had. The only disappointment was the lamb belly. Had amazing flavor but it just does not melt in your mouth like pork belly. Parts of it I had to spit out. Not because it tasted bad but because it was just not breaking down in my mouth.

I started in Houston and drove 10,000 miles (I'm not exaggerating) through every state west of the line from Houston up to Canada. I saw every National Park along the way, and every touristy item in the big cities. And I camped or slept in the car EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. For 31 DAYS. Except for Vegas, thus bringing me to my review. 

Las Vegas was 2 nights out of the trip towards the end of the trip. I had 2-3 nights left on the road after leaving Vegas, so you can bet that while I was there, I was dead tired. 

First of all, this hotel is advertised to be near the strip. It's not. I mean it is, but it's not. I thought it would be walking distance, because I called the hotel and asked- it's really really not. They lied. They did tell the truth about the shuttles though. They are free and they do take you ""near"" the strip. But it's still a walking distance, and you have to wait almost an hour before you can ever get on one. AND! They stop picking people up to take them back to the hotel at 11:30 pm. Like what? I'm barely getting out on a Friday night at 11:30pm. We had to Uber back. 

Second, check in. It cannot get any worse. First, there's very little parking for hotel guests and NO parking for handicapped individuals near an entrance. Then there's a huge wait at the check in desk in the casino lobby. I was promised a clean, good view, and easy to access room and walked a very long distance with two very heavy luggage that unfortunately did not have wheels to my room- only to find that my room was already occupied by lots of stuff belonging to other people currently staying in this room. 

I proceeded to drag my luggage's all the way downstairs back through the casino (this is no short walk, people) and winded, I was forced to wait in line at check in all over again. I tried to speak to a manager, but none were available. Finally, I reached the check in window to explain to the front desk my situation. They were very unsympathetic and assigned me another room. The manager finally came to talk to me, and he apologized but did nothing to rectify my situation. I asked for a luggage carrier to take my luggage back up, because I didn't have the strength for another trip, and he promised one would be with me right away. 

I waited 20 minutes for a luggage carrier and when none came, I dragged my luggages alllll the way back to my new room. Alone. 

The room had a nice view of the strip allll the way in the distance, and it was clean. Except for the random mosquito-spider looking bug on the ceiling, and the outlet that didn't work. 

The pool was filled with lots of people and little shade. You also are expected to walk through a small portion of the casino in your bathing suit to get to the pool. Awk. 

At night, the hotel was anything but quiet. 

And at check out, you have to wait in the really long line all over again. No one asked about my experience. No one cared that they messed up my two nights of peace out of 31 days on the road. It was the one place I decided to have a bed to rest in, and these people could have cared less.

The girl who performed it was very knowledgable about preventative healthcare measures and alternate treatments. I was very impressed. We just talked our way through the session. 

For those of you wondering how it feels, it is not painful at all just a bit uncomfortable because you have the sensation that you want to poo but you are not supposed to squeeze or push.

All 3 of those stars are for the food... the ambiance, bathrooms, service, etc... are just eh.

They have a brunch menu on Saturday and Sunday and their regular menu has a nice variety of Mexican\/Caribbean inspired food, such as quesadillas, burritos and the like. 

I ordered huevos rancheros from the brunch menu for $7. I also asked for avocado on the side but note - it wasn't worth the $1 extra for the tiny cup. My plate was much bigger than I was expecting for the price! Beans, huevos rancheros topped with salsa and onion and cheese. I would definitely recommend that entree. 

I'd like to come back and try taco Tuesday, but I've heard it gets really crowded. They also have a happy hour from 3-7pm with half priced beers.

I was there attending a conference and was delighted with the family style appetizers and salad that was served at each table. The spinach flat bread pizza, bread basket which included banana bread was awesome. The remaining appetizers included port pot stickers and calamari calamari which were nothing to scream about. However the bamboo salad (i think they called it) was delicious. It was served family style with walnuts, goat cheese and apples throughout the bowl. I in fact had two servings. The dinner unfortunately I was not too impressed with. I ordered the grilled halibut with steamed veggies. I do have to say that the presentation was nice, they were served in bamboo dishes that were covered when brought to the table and the server removed their tops once they were served to you. The halibut was too dry for my taste and my friends who actually asked for a side of dipping sauce to eat with it and the veggies for being steamed were also really dry and plain. 
The desert which is what I read had the best reviews was not that great for me. The cotton candy is HUGE I'll give them that but honestly who can finish a bowl of cotton candy as big as they serve it. The remaining desert were just ordinary rice crispy treats, hostess cupcakes, coconut bon bon and cookies.

My partner got three mini cupcakes (red velvet, cookies and cream, and vanilla) and quite enjoyed all three. If I were to rate solely on those cupcakes then it would most likely be a 4\/5.

However - I am gluten free and chose the chocolate with vanilla icing and the chocolate with chocolate icing. It was tasty - but honestly tasted like a boxed cupcake mix - and the cupcakes fell apart on my plate. I ended up having to eat them with a fork and it was a total mess.

I was really looking forward to try the foie gras poutine. When I got there, the place was packed and the hostess told us that the entire night was booked and without reservations for that night and the next, it would be impossible to get a table. This was understandable since it was a very popular restaurant. However, what really bothered me t was the hostess's attitude. I then asked her if I can get the foie gras poutine to go. She almost rolled her eyes and stood there as if she couldn't believe that I didn't just give up and leave.  And as I was in the middle of ordering, she turned around without a word and left for 5 min. When she came back, I resumed my order. After my order, she immediately added that there will be no utensils with my order in a really snarky attitude. Wow, I am sorry to have inconvenienced you by ordering a 30 dollar dish to go and one for each person in a three people party without you even having to serve it. Guess you really don't appreciate business. Finally, as we were waiting outside, I decided to go in to let her know that we are waiting outside to the left of the entrance in case she can't find us. She immediately says, ""It's not ready yet!"" For a popular and upscale restaurant, having a hostess like that really gives it a bad reputation. 

When we finally sat down to eat our poutine, the hostess's attitude already took half the joy out of it. The poutine itself tasted like normal poutine you get in Montreal with chunks of foie gras mixed in. The portion of foie gras was generous however I don't think it was worth the 20+ dollars extra compared to a normal poutine. Especially when it seemed to be just added in without having a sear or anything. I feel that the dish can be improved tremendously if a nice sear was given to the outside of the foie gras to add a next contrast of textures. 

Overall, this restaurant is just okay. I would not go back for the food and the hostess's attitude was definitely a turn off.",0,0,0

The week before we had a reservation, but when we got there the AC was broken and it was hotter inside than out. Obviously, that's not their fault, but what irritated me was when the hostess said they contacted everyone on the reservation list to notify them of the fact. No you didn't, but okay. 

So, the following week we make another reservation and this time the AC is working. If it were just about the food this place would get four stars. My partner had the classic steak and fries, which he said was good, but not as good as The Keg, which, he added, is cheaper. I had the pork chop wrapped in cheese and ham. It was absolutely delicious. One suggestion: a little bit more potatoes and veggies would be nice. It felt like I was eating pure saturated fat for dinner with the meat wrapped in more meat as 80% of the meal. Anyway, on to the service. At first I thought it was nice that three different servers (one was the owner) were waiting on us, but after a while it became annoying. One would come and ask the same question that the other just had two minutes before. 

On to the bill. We were charged $13 for a dessert port that was clearly priced at $10 in the dessert menu. I politely pointed this out to the hostess (who is also a server?) who argued with me until she finally looked up the price, came back, and said ""it must have rung in incorrectly"". Okay, that's fine. So she fixes it and brings us the new bill without saying a word. No ""sorry about that"" or even the usual ""thank you"". And when we left no one said a word to us. In fact, at 10pm the restaurant was empty while The Keg (which is across the street) was still packed. Not a good sign indeed.

The sliders were much smaller than the waitress made them out to be (I had asked her how big they were). Normally a slider meal will come with 3-4 sliders at that size, but this one only had 2.

I came in on a Monday, filled out the application, and took the tests that evaluated my skills on the Microsoft Office Suite. Of which, I scored very well. Less than a week later, I'm employed as a temp working in the audit department of a major casino on the strip.

But that was then...

After taking a break from the job scene to get my degree, I head back to Manpower with hopes of getting some work. I walk into the office and am greeted by a completely different staff. Albeit, they were very friendly. But what shocked me is the caliber of workers applying. I've always thought Manpower to be a primary provider for office work. I was wrong. It looked like ""casual Friday"" in the waiting area. I felt clearly overdressed for what I thought was going to be an interviewing process.

I meet with my assigned worker, who updates my information, asks me a few questions, and decides that I should take the evaluations again. I agree and finish scoring only a few points less than my prior tests (of which I find out they still had on file). I sit in the chair across from the worker while she takes another call which, apparently, was more important than helping me find employment. 

As I sit there patiently, I overhear the worker at the next desk over talk with a casino client who happens to have to the same job open that I had a few years ago. Excited about the prospective job, when my worker finally got off the phone, I ask about the position. I tell her that I used to work that job through them before. She checks my record verifying this but then tells me that I'm ""not qualified"".

The job requires a ""high-advanced"" level use of the Microsoft Office Suite. I only scored as an ""Expert"" level user. I asked her to look at my previous scores (where I scored in the higher bracket) and she tells me that they have to go with the most recent score. Meanwhile, a Hispanic man in jeans and flannel button up gets a job working as warehouse laborer.

There is also bar space where you can sit and enjoy a drink and appetizer or even dinner. The service was great. Very attentive.

I narrowed it down to the skinny guy sandwich which is Grilled chicken, sauteed eggplant, roasted peppers & fresh mozzarella drizzled with extra virgin olive oil & balsamic vinegar. I got it on whole wheat and the bread was fresh and soft. The fresh basil and fresh mozzarella definitely made this sandwich. It was amazing. I also had a small greek salad and the tomatoes were farm fresh and the dressing was light and flavorful. 

My boyfriend had the steak sandwich which was Filet mignon, mushrooms & onions with melted mozzarella servedon garlic bread. He barely spoke the entire meal because he was shoveling the sandwich in. He even went so far as saying that it was the best sandwich he's had in a long time!

They catered a Thanksgiving event at Arizona State University which was free to students, although I'm sure ASU had to pay.

The vegetables and stuffing were all overcooked into mush. The broccoli was overcooked not just to being mush, but was in fact browned. It was also unseasoned. The carrots while mushy at least had some seasoning on them. I'm guessing they used up all the salt on what resembled turkey breast slices. 
The oversalted turkey was mystery meat of the Chicken McNugget type.

The high point was the brownies, which were pretty darn good! =)

To be honest, I wouldn't go to any event with the draw of them catering with food. My girlfriend also said they catered once where she works and characterized the food as 'cafeteria style slop ... edible but not worth paying for.'",1,0,0

We really like that Bee my baby has an on-site playground and the children spend time outside most days, at least when there is nice weather. We also appreciate that the meals are home-cooked. And we like it that the age groups are often allowed ""mixed play time"" with other ages.

With regard to the staff, there seems to be a lot of fluctuation. In the 8 months we've been at Bee My Baby, the teacher for my 4-year-old has changed 3 times and the teacher for my 2-year-old has also changed 3 times. It has been a mixed bag, with some teachers really connecting with the boys and other ones basically ignoring the children and spending their day on their cell phone. Sadly, the teachers we like seem to leave BmB as often as the ones we're not so crazy about.

Another thing that could be improved is that the classrooms for different ages are separated, which used to bring our 2-year-old to tears when he can see his older brother but can't go to him. However, they seem to have relaxed this policy or our 2-year-old has become more comfortable with his age group. 

We are grateful that we asked for and received more flexibility during the ""nap-time"" after lunch. Our 4-year-old doesn't nap anymore, so he doesn't have to remain on his mattress for the full 90 minutes, as the staff sometimes lets him get up and play before naptime is officially over.",2,0,0

PWbKNGp9f0amge0HrGzdew,9yh8Qv8MR2ajONGavj6FdQ,tshN5rYRrzanHu4ZiwCVrA,2,2015-06-06,"I love the Olive Garden and I've been a fan for over twenty years now. I will say that my experience at the Northlake location last night was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, and I wish I was exaggerating. 

The night started off with the waiter telling my parents (who got there before my twin sister and I did) after they asked that the breadstick chicken parmesan sandwich was available at dinner time. The only difference would be that the sandwich would be $10.99 instead of $6.99. I made sure to order it when I heard it was available!

After my family ordered, the waiter came back twice to ask questions about my parents'  orders and still didn't seem clear about what they wanted from the ""2 for 25"" Tuscan dinner items. He never wrote anything down, which was alarming and I believe added to his confusion.

The waiter brought us breadsticks with DIRTY PLATES. When we asked for more plates, he brought us salad with DIRTY BOWLS. What was going on in that kitchen?! My dad is a restaurant owner and we do understand how things happen so we thought it was a one off situation the first time, but multiple dirty plates is inexcusable.

Then the waiter came back and said he was wrong, the breadstick chicken parm sandwich was NOT available at dinner and I'd have to order something else. I asked why he had told us it was after we asked earlier and he said another coworker told him the wrong thing. I thought it was ridiculous they couldn't just make it since it's not like they don't have the ingredients, so I got up and found the manager.

I told the manager I was unhappy and asked why the sandwich was unavailable and he said it is, they just have to clear it with me since it's not on the dinner menu.  Olive Garden clearly needs to work on their communication issue about the breadstick sandwiches if the employees don't know what's going on and this has been a huge promotion for them.

We were hoping the sandwich issue would be the last issue, but it was just the beginning of a downward spiral. My dad asked for a beer FIVE TIMES and the waiter didn't bring it - not a refill, but the beer he ordered when he sat down!  He finally got it after all of those requests. We never got salad or bread at the same time  - it was always one or the other, despite our repeated requests for both.

The table behind us had two kids who were screaming most of the meal. I know that is not on Olive Garden, but it definitely put us on the edge and we didn't ask to move since we knew we'd probably already been written off by the staff as ""that table"" and we didn't want to make our waiter even more confused.

When our entrees came, it got even worse. Both of my parents' entrees looked disgusting. My mom's pasta looked like it was half cooked and my dad's pasta barely had any sauce on it. They told the waiter that the food wasn't good and he did switch them out for two other entrees.

At the end of the meal, we were all just completely fed up and we asked to talk to the manager about the experience. He seemed patronizing and kept trying to minimize our feedback. At that point, we were just ready to go. We got our bill and it had an extra charge for an antipasti salad that no one ordered. We told the waiter about that (and also gave him our 20% off coupon) and when he came back, he told us the manager decided to comp the entrees and we only paid for two soft drinks and a beer. We did still leave a 25% tip based on the original total because we knew it wasn't fair for us to only spend $13.

We didn't expect the meals to be comped, but we were grateful and appreciative. However, the manager ruined his act of goodwill when as we were walking out, we saw him and my dad thanked him, but also said he didn't have to comp all of the entrees and the manager said it was no problem.  After we walked by him and I sat in the lobby waiting for my family members at the end of the night, I witnessed him talking loudly and mocking my family to another employee. I glared at him until he felt the gaze, and he came over to me and tried to laugh it off, but the damage was done. That was unprofessional and should never happen! I was polite since I didn't want to cause a scene and we all just wanted to leave, but are you kidding me?! What a way to add disgusting icing to an already inedible cake!

I'm giving 2 stars because we've had good experiences at this location in the past. I'd give -10 stars based on last night.",5,0,0

I was pushing for Barro's, but my sister talked me into trying Naked Pizza (since every time we see their fliers and crowds of employees on the side of the road we say ""Hey. We should try that place. Sometime.)

Online ordering was super easy. There is a $10 minimum for delivery, and since my one-topping thin crust 14"" pizza came to $9.88, I added a $.35 dipping sauce to bring the total up. With tax and delivery charge, it was about $13. 

Pizza arrived like 20 minutes later. Very fast. They totally forgot the dipping sauce. I guess I don't mind since I didn't want it in the first place. But still. I paid for it. What if I *had* really wanted it?

I guess I didn't really think about how small a 14"" pizza was while I was ordering. I just chose the biggest option. I was kind of disappointed . Also, there were very few mushrooms. I counted only 12 on a pizza with 8 slices. Super sad. 

The taste was good. Some of the reviews here mentioned thinking the regular crust was kind of weird, so I was playing it safe and ordered thin crust.  Next time I'll risk it. Turned out to be VERY thin crust. Like paper thin. And since that all-natural cheese still produces a lot of grease, it was kind of gross to eat. (With a thicker crust, I imagine more of the grease would soak in).

With tip, I spent $15 total. The experience wasn't worth that to me. Next time, I'll just get a regular crust cheese pizza (why spend extra money for such skimpy toppings?). And I'll pick it up on the way home from work to save on extra costs (delivery, bogus-dipping-sauce-charges, and tipping). A $9 price tag sounds more appropriate for the experience.",1,0,0

If you want to go to an Italian restaurant that has that wow factor and truly amazing flavours, then go to a place like Buca, Blu Ristorante, or Enoteca Sociale, or a number of other better places. 
I'm not hating on Fabbrica, the food is tasty with very good service. The thing is, it's a Mcewan restaurant, and so it's fair to expect a higher standard. However, it seems to me that Mcewan is no longer the standard in Toronto. The Mcewan name sells itself as a premier name in the toronto restaurant scene, especially when you always see Mark Mcewan on shows like Top chef Canada, at times scolding aspiring chefs for not meeting his standards, lol. But after eating at Fabbrica, I'm wondering what that standard really is?!
It's certainly isn't high end anymore, not at Fabbrica, but quite honestly I feel that other Mcewan restaurants like North 44 are no longer what they used to be either. You're not going to find inspired and creative excellence at a Mcewan restaurant, but you will get reliable quality food. And that's what Fabbrica was, it was reliable and we enjoyed the food. 
One more drawback I would mention is the crowded spacing of the tables. They pack people in a little too close to the next table, which makes it very uncomfortable for people. One shouldn't have to struggle to get in and out of their seat.

The perfect scenario: you had too much to drink the other night, you roll out of bed with a hangover, your stomach is growling, and you want to go somewhere where you can be in your pj's practically and no one will notice or care, head to 5th Avenue Cafe.

On two occasions (when signing my 12-month agreement and my 1-month lease extension agreement) I noticed that the price listed on the paper contract they drafted was higher than advertised\/discussed and had to point this out. They said it was accident on both of these occasions. 

Additionally, the dissemination of information was poor. I felt that the respect for privacy and tenants' personal plans was poor as well. Management would announce that a parking, garage, or the pool was being closed, or that they would be entering your apartment for ""inspections"" by posting a sheet of paper on the wall or your door with only a day or a few days' notice.

The management was poor until the last 1 month of my stay. I think management is going in a much better direction now though (replacement.) I hope it is going in a new direction.

UQtAXLjO6ATZtOKmybDGGg,_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,f-2pMptlB6cWaWnU7zYE_A,4,2017-07-12,"I've finally started to feel good about Henderson's food scene after a long history of discontent, and now it has even more legitimacy with this newest location of a burger chain with a massive cult following.

If you haven't heard about Shake Shack, they're a very popular chain that's grown from a humble New York City park kiosk to, by my count, 75 locations spanning the United States and even more overseas. The Henderson restaurant is located at the edge of the main portion of The District at Green Valley Ranch, with a corner location that is very easily sighted if you're entering from Green Valley Parkway. Expect to have a decent walk from eligible parking spots, unless you're cheating via one of the designated areas for nearby offices...

Today was only my second time ever going to a Shake Shack, and I was surprised that there wasn't more of a line for their grand opening. Although the details aren't publicized, they seem to have free goodies for the first 100 people, including dessert and Shake Shack-branded (cheap) sunglasses. The ordering line was still a bit slow for how many people there were due to training, but I'm sure they'll pick up the pace soon enough.

They do offer an app on iOS and (very recently on) Android if you wish to place your order half an hour or more ahead, then walk directly to the pick-up area at the arranged time. Otherwise, you should probably expect a line as word emerges that they've opened here, and don't be surprised if you have to wait outside in the heat because the indoor designated waiting area is rather small compared to a location like the one on the Las Vegas Strip.

If it wasn't obvious by the calorie counts on the menu replete with a variety of burgers, hot dogs, fries, desserts, and drinks (including beer and wine), the meals here can get quite filling. I didn't expect the complimentary single-size Pie Oh My ($4.65 normally), but it was a fun concrete with pretty good peach pie and vanilla custard. The only concern is that it melts while you're trying to eat everything else, so you'd be better off ordering it again afterward.

I did have to polish off dessert first, lest it turn into dessert soup, but the rest of the meal was delicious. The Double SmokeShack ($9.69) was thoroughly enjoyable from the meaty Angus patties through to the potato bun, with the chopped cherry peppers packing a more restrained punch than the more commonplace jalapeño and the Niman Ranch bacon and ShackSauce filling out the rest of the flavor. I did have a concern about the meat not being cooked to medium (the only other option available aside from well done), but I'll let it go because the cashier was clearly still in training. Next time though, I'll double-check my receipt.

The Fries ($2.99) are quite tasty as well. They're crinkle cut and properly seasoned, and they're fried to a golden brown crisp while still being fluffy inside. They're fine alone or with ketchup. I found myself sorely lacking them during my first trip to a Shake Shack, and they're vital to a burger experience. Split an order with a friend if you want to make the calorie hit a bit easier.

The dining room was pretty spacious but can get crowded. They also have two television sets currently, as well as a shuffleboard table and a foosball table. I doubt that they'll add darts to complete the collection, but those games should at least be fun diversions for the kids, who were the only ones playing while I was there.

I enjoy Shake Shack a lot, although I don't quite _love_ love them to that 5-star extreme yet. They offer fast service but are certainly at least a tier up from any ""fast food"" places. That said, they also come at significantly higher costs (note: all Shake Shack locations that I've looked up are priced surprisingly similarly) that make me start to compare them to local burger joints as well, not just the obvious competitor chains. That said, they're definitely very good based on this meal alone, so I'll likely revisit them more often now that I don't have to make a trek to Summerlin or deal with the crowds and paid parking of the Strip.",9,4,5

But if you want some fast, greasy Chinese food (let's be real, we've all been there), Mandarin will be just fine. You'll be seated within minutes and can be stuffing your face with noodles even faster. Sometimes you just crave some Chinese, and Mandarin will be waiting for you.

The space is newly renovated and looks fantastic. Inside, its absolutely huge, so you'll never wait for a seat. This buffet is broken up into a few parts: traditional buffet, sushi and stir-fry. Admittedly, I usually gravitate just to the buffet, where i'm a fan of the green beans, various noodle choices, and buttery crab dishes. On high volume nights, they'll have crab legs, oysters, and various shrimps. The buffet is super clean, and there's definitely this vibe of ""no one is going to judge you for how big your plate is."" So if you're out with a burly man, let him go nuts and have a Game of Thrones feast. This is also an awesome place to go with a big group-- just call ahead to let them know.

It comes with your choice of an orange mimosa or champagne. The buffet isn't that big, but they have a fair amount of different kinds of food. You can have omelets made any time you want. They had Asian, Italian, Mexican, sandwiches, a carving station, salad\/fruit bar, dessert and ice cream area. Overall the food was ok. It made me full; nothing special, but you can watch people in The Tank, which is the Golden Nugget's pool area. There are gigantic fishes in that tank along with sharks :]",2,1,1

I was greeted by Jacqueline who is just the cutest gal with a sweet and welcoming personality. 

I ordered the fried mochiko bowl $7.99, an ala carte chicken tender $1.29 and ala carte belgian waffle $1.59.

If you order an ala carte belgian waffle as informed does not come with syrup. Hmmm? I like syrup on my waffle so there is an extra charge of 50 cents. My favorite part of the entire meal was the belgian waffle. I could live on those, they are so good. 

The chicken tender was good, juicy and flavorful however did not come with a dipping sauce. Once again it would have been an extra 50 cents. My Mochiko chicken bowl was white rice with breaded fried chicken chunks on top. I assumed from previous yelp photos I had viewed that there would be a sauce on it. My bowl needed something on it for sure in order to enjoy it.

I went and asked the employee if they have any sauce that I can add to my bowl. She replied yes, for what bowl, for the Mochiko bowl she suggested a sweet sauce. Also that will be an additional .50 cents. I had to have it because the bowl would have been too plain to eat without it. There was just too much white rice to have eaten it dry. 

I just feel like all of the items I ordered needed something to complete them, sauce and or dipping sauce. I had the chicken tender , no dipping sauce, belgian waffle, no syrup, mochiko fried chicken bowl no sauce.  

I think they should just increase their menu prices and include the sauce, dipping sauce and or syrup needed to complete the meal. After hearing ""that will be an additional 50 cents"" for the third time I was over the experience. 

I may be back, however I think I will just get the chicken and waffles bowl. At least it will include the two tablespoons of syrup.",14,7,9

They absolutely allow you to check into your room early .. For a fee (like if the room is ready regardless why do I have to pay an extra fee). You are charged a daily resort fee of something along the lines of 30-40 dollars a day which is totally standard ( for use of gym, wifi, ect..) however .. The wifi didn't work my entire stay and I got NO SERCIVE in my room so I kept missing calls from my friends that were meeting us!!! The house keeping service does nothing besides make the beds and take the glassware away, but the geniuses forget to give you new glassware. I called the front desk and asked for new glasses to be sent up and they told me it was going to be a charge of $7.50. Seriously ??? House keeping took all of our glasses and then you refuse to sent me new ones ?! How am I suppose to drink the extremely over priced champagne and liquor I was going to drink from your mini bar !! (There you go, you lost another sale) I'm staying in a ""5 star resort"" I would think they can send up glasses to my room with out charging me. It seems the only people who receive good customer service are the big time gamblers which is normal. But hey I came here to spend my money too ! Just because I decide to spend my money and delicious food and drinks instead of a poker game does not mean I deserve to be treated like a peasant. Me and my friends got horrible service at the two restaurants in the hotel that we decided to visit ( Jardin & the buffet) I think we were discriminated on because we do look very young and the state probably assumed we didn't have money to tip. But hello !!!! I have money to stay at this hotel and eat here so obviously I have money to tip. (Plus I was a waitress and I'm always a good tipper so shame on you for judging us on our age) none of the staff even offered a smile or a ""welcome"" or checked up on us to see how the food and drinks were. Just took our order and delivered the check. When we visited the buffet my friend was wearing high waisted shorts and a crop top and she was told she had to buy one of their t shirts because that's their dress code (LOL it's 115 degrees in Vegas and we can't wear crop tops ?!?!) any ways she did purchase the shirt because we were starving but once we were in the buffet we saw a girl wearing a bathing suit top and they didn't make her buy a t shirt !! So I went up to the manager and asked her to give us a refund for the shirt because it wasn't fair that the rules didn't apply to every body and she refused and told me ""exit to the left now please"" I felt so disrespected I couldn't believe she spoke to a paying customer that way. If you want good customer service and you want to enjoy your stay in Vegas DONT STAY AT THE ENCORE OR THE WYNN !!!! I will definitely be returning to Vegas but I will NOT stay at this hotel ever again. Also I spoke to several managers about my complaint and none of them cared to help me or give me any type of accommodations to make up for this horrible experience so that was a huge let down.",0,2,0

We ordered their Dry Aged Bone-In Ribeye for two and it was to die for. Me and my Fiancé were in heaven, it is a very upscale restaurant and I kid you not I was tempted to pick up the bone itself and eat off of it because the steak was that good.

We were looking to have a few drinks and a light snack before heading over to the festival. We headed over to the bar while we waited for our table to be ready. I tried the spicy margarita, wasn't my favorite - it was a bit too bubbly for me for a margarita, but every place has their own recipes.

Once our table was ready, we sat down and looked for what we wanted. Again, we wanted something small, so we were going to split a chips and queso. We are told that they are completely out of chips. As a restaurant serving Mexican food, that was a huge letdown. So back to the drawing board. 

We order another round of drinks while we're deciding what to order. The drink I asked for had a floater in it. Usually, those drinks come with the shot floating on top. The waitress told me to let her know if it was in the drink. I've never been there before, and as a first timer getting that drink, how am I supposed to know? So she did bring it back to the bar, and they poured a shot in there, so not sure if I was drinking double what was supposed to be in there.

After we placed our order (an order of taquitos and the boys split the 3 taco order) - we see tables around us receiving baskets of chips. This was disappointing - the waitress told us they were out. If they were just making more, we would have waited. Disappointing to see around us.

As a new customer, I HOPE that this is the norm, and that Sprouts actually has quality meats year round.  

The produce department has some nice looking seasonal favorites this time of year. And the prices are competitive to boot. So we picked out some staples and some Fall fruit. They also provide an extensive bulk bin area.  

All in all we were both please with our experience at Sprouts and will be returning.  Maybe, they can take up residents in some of the soon to be vacant Fresh & Easy locations.",7,4,6

I first used this business when my hot water tank went out...it wasn't leaking but I was having the hardest time trying to light the pilot. Not trying to blow up my house, I called them. They promptly got back to me, had a technician come out, and he said I had an issue with the thermocoupler. After a replacement, all was good.
I called them recently because the same water heater is now leaking. You know, leaks are no good...almost always means you need a new one. And of course this happens on a weekend. I called Beverly at 9pm on Sat...and the rep states ""I can't schedule you an appointmnet"". So I ask her what my options are. She told me that they could have a plumber come out, but since it's after 7pm, the service fee would be $119. Come one, really? She told me if I called in the morning it would be $79. So I called in the morning. The woman indicated that the technician would call me back - and he did. We discussed prices...and that's as far as we got. For a standard 40 gallon water heater to be installed...they were talking in excess of $800 with everything. It took everything within my power not to scream. That's highway robbery! I'm not stupid, I know how much a hot water tank costs...and I have to assume they must think I'm stupid...which is an insult. I ended up going with another company, who was much more reasonable.

There were six of us without a reservation and we were nonetheless accommodated by a less than interested, less than personable host. Once at our table, we were greeted by our server, Jacob, who would prove to be the highlight of our dining experience. Beyond Jacob, the menu items and peripheral services fell flat. 
There were 4 appetizers ordered: Cuban Cigars, Cheese and Bacon Board, Paprika Hummus and Spicy Chick Peas.
Cuban Cigars: the menu stated there would be 6 pieces. Pieces was right, as only 3 ""cigars"" were served, each cut in half on the diagonal. Less quantity  than expected and quite flavorless aside from the delicious aioli dipping sauce.
Cheese and Bacon Board: hard, burned bacon served with a non-descipt Mozzarella-like cheese, a Bechamal-cheesy dip, burnt bread and slivered fruit and vegetable choices.
Paprika Hummus: though quite tasty, it was extremely dry and grainy, which drew so many distracting and unflattering comments from around the table, it was difficult to really appreciated the flavor.
Spicy Chick Peas: good flavor yet, there was a somewhat moist texture to them which created a weird sensation in your mouth.
Our entrées included the Scallops and Pancetta over mashed potatoes (with added shrimp). Requested was a side of bread from a nameless server to sop up the red sauce, and only after 15 minutes when Jacob intervened, did the bread finally arrive to begin a now cold meal. Though the flavors were nice, the scallops were undercooked and had a metallic taste to them that stung the tongue. The side of bread was the same burned bread as before, which made any sopping up near impossible.
Another entrée was the Boursin Mac with added Katsu Chicken. Made with a very non-mac pasta like Orecchiette, which wasn't salted while cooking, the stick together pasta barely held on to the thin Boursin sauce, which though somewhat flavorful, was just as understated as a box of mac and cheese from Fry's. The added chicken was overly deep fried, dry and flavorless.
The remaining entrées were various burgers which appeared to be ""your average burger"", and a Crouque Monsieur, none of which received much more than a little aplomb. 
Dessert proved to be just as weak as the entrées. Though Jacob had prepared us by letting us know that the cheesecake and Germany Chocolate cake were not house made, he couldn't have prepared us enough for the dull presentations or the lacking flavors of both. The house made cherry and port wine sauce was the only bright star of the course.
Leaving the restaurant, we agreed we had enjoyed our own fellowship and the great Jacob, while lttle was said about a return visit to Corduroy. The 3 stars are due to Jacob's great service and personality.",1,0,0

Anyway, I eat a burger about once a month and don't really know what a GREAT one tastes like because they just aren't top on my list of food items I have to have often. Pizza, on the other hand.. oh yeah.

So, I've been to Nix several times and each time I get the same dang burger because when I want a burger I prefer it to consist of this: Beef, Cheddar cheese, Bacon, Fried onion strings, Barbecue sauce: a Cowboy burger! You can find those anywhere but Nix's is really great and their fries are the trusty little crinkle cuts! I don't think these burgers are just as good as Big (Bad) Daddy's but they are still very delicious. 

They are located in the heart of uptown but close fairly early at night (I'm sure to avoid the super drunk crowd). They have a small bar, which is usually where I sit, and a decent beer selection as well. Nix is one of the bars in Charlotte that I have found to carry Seadog Blueberry. Yummmm.
Caution: You will be full when you leave here! 

Also, the decor inside the restaurant is pretty cool. There are large chrome rims that hang and are placed in the dining room for a more casual rock type feel.

Teh adovado was pretty good, and had a great apricot chutney on top that worked well with it. From my experience, it was 3.5 starts.

Arriving the place seemed PACKED. asked the hostess to put our name in 
(4 people) and she said it was going to be 45 minutes. Walked around to the bar which was also packed and got some mimosas. Then we started looking around. All though the place seemed packed, only about  1\/2 their tables were occupied. We soon found out the reason: owner and\/or manager was this old mean lady who was incredibly rude to both customers and wait staff. 
Finally a waiter snuck us into an empty table in his section after seeing us standing at the bar for 30 minutes. Manager\/owner then proceeded to come over and yell at him in front of all the diners. Despite her actions the waiter held his ground and we were able to keep our table. 
Our waiter was awesome! he totally took care of everything we wanted, kept our waters full, joked around with us about, gave us some great advice about where to visit, and talked us through the whole menu. He even brought a sample of the chocolate bacon for us to try!
This is what we had:
Bloddy Marry- Loved the veggies and chocolate cover bacon that came with this. However the mixer seemed a little thin and tasteless to me. All in all 4 stars
Pumpkin Cheesecake Pancakes-Not enough Pumpkin flavor for us personally, but they were still great. Eat these fast! 4 stars
Caprese Benedict-Egg was poached perfectly and the pesto tasted amazing. 5 stars
Breakfast Burger-Fried leeks were amazing but the burger meat itself needed more flavoring. 5 stars
Dutch Apple French Toast-Apples were cooked perfectly and the cinnamon butter was to die for. 5 stars
Prosciutto & Chocolate Chip Waffles-Super yummy, but it was bacon not prosciutto served with it. 5 stars

All in all we will definitely be coming back here because of the food and the wait staff. Hopefully the manager\/owner will start to understand she needs to work behind the scenes a bit more.",1,0,0

Ok, so Rehab is still one of the best pool parties in Las Vegas. Encore Beach Club is probably going to catch them this year but, for the most part, it is still going to be at or on the top of the list. 

Staying at the HRH used to be a big PLUS when attending Rehab because you got in for free. Depending on WHERE YOU BOOK YOUR HOTEL (i.e. at the HRH website, Vegas.com, Expedia, etc..) your ROOM RATE MAY NOT QUALIFY, meaning that you will have to pay to get into the pool party. As a hotel guest, you still get the luxury of waiting in a not-so-ridiculously long line. Just remember, if you save money on the room, you are going to pay for it in line at Rehab. If you have a big group with you, better to pay the extra on the hotel and get the group in to Rehab for free. 

It seems as though the overall experience at Rehab depends largely on whether you are going on a three-day weekend or not. The times that I have gone on a regular weekend have tended to be the most memorable. People are more friendly, less knuckleheads, a little more space, etc... I recommend going on a regular weekend and taking Monday off. If you do go on a three-day weekend, expect MORE and LESS. MORE money, people, wait time for drinks, and knuckleheads. LESS space and than friendly people.

This is not to be confused with the staff who are always on point. 

They used to play a lot of house music but now, mostly hip hop. I am cool with both but the house music was some of the best I have ever heard. Too bad they don't play that anymore. 

Rehab is still the spot in LV, don't get it twisted. Just remember to have your expectations set accordingly. If you go on a three day weekend, try and go with a large group cause people there don't seem to be as friendly and outgoing as compared to other, non-three day weekends. 

My friends would not let me get away without saying the following: Do not accept mints from people you don't know... TRUST, I learned that lesson the hard way (review of Sunrise Medical to follow). 

Finally and most importantly, STAY OUT OF THE POOL.",15,7,3

Of all the restaurants that deliver to our house this is by far the fastest (but that might have something to do with being to closest as well).

My main complaint with this location is accuracy. I almost always order the beach club and the only customization I make is no mayo and sometimes add mustard. Yet last time my sandwich came without tomato or cucumber. Two times before that there was no lettuce. Once I was sure they did not include guac only to find the smallest bit in between cheese slices on only one half of my sandwich. Ordering it cut in half is about a 50\/50 chance it will come that way.

Seriously, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. And the line and the grill station was ridiculous. It should have been a sign to the management that they needed to add another line for the food, or increase the staffing. We're talking about food that is already cooked and portioned, so there should be very little time spent getting it. But it was the only part of the place with any line, other than the line to get in. I ended up giving into hunger and went to the pasta line instead and had pasta primavera. But it was terrible. it was oily and flavorless. It had literally four pieces of vegetables in it. And I saw him prepare it for me. Yet by the time I got back to the table it was already cold. How is this possible? Cold plate, very briefly cooked food. 

There was no sour cream at the potato station. Ask for it and someone will carry a blob of it on a spoon from the kitchen. The salad bar requires you to ask someone to scoop the ingredients onto a small plate. The result is unappetizing. All the ingredient bins were picked over and the quantities given were miniscule. The resulting salad was terrible. And they were not very friendly. And no, I was not complaining or being difficult. They were just flat and unresponsive people.

On the upside, I did not get food poisoning, which is the only reason it gets two stars and not one. I recommend going the food courts over this dreck.

Tapas restaurants are always frustrating to me because I can never seem to order the right amount of food and as a result always seem to leave hungry. To make matters worse, the food always seems to be pretty pricey so I'm not only hungry, but my wallet is significantly lighter to boot. This place is no different. The prices on some of the items border on exorbitant, which wouldn't be so upsetting to me given it's prime Strip location, except for the fact that I didn't leave full.

OK, enough about the prices. The tapas were very well prepared and came out in a timely manner. Definitely order the ahi tuna tempura and a couple of beef dishes. My strategy with tapas is always to mix vegetable dishes, meat dishes, and fish dishes and I always get some sort of cheese.

I was hungry, but for something light. I decided on Pho.

Read the reviews and decided to go.
Inside it was clean and inviting.
The staff was very friendly.
I ordered to-go.

Pho Nam, Spring Rolls and Summer Rolls...not to adventurous.
My order was quickly prepared and off I went.

Everything was very good. The broth had actual flavor, not just a clear broth.
Ample additions such as the bean sprouts, Thai basil, jalapenos, cilantro, a wedge of lime, peanut sauce, garlic chili sauce, hoisin, sirachi and a vinegar\/fish sauce (?) all came with it.

My favorite was the chicken shawarma, marinated chicken and some veggies with a garlic spread wrapped in a pita which is baked on-premises. The baklava-type desserts consisted of flaky pastry with a custard-type of filling. Forgive me for not knowing the exact names of the ingredients as I know very little about the ins and outs of Middle Eastern food other than putting it IN my mouth!

We were seated promptly and given menus however we sat there for at least 30 minutes watching patrons who arrived later than us getting served and getting their food before our orders were even taken. My boyfriend and I were starting to get impatient and were trying to think of polite ways to wave somebody down. The staff made eye contact with him but did not approach us. Finally someone walked past us and we advised them we were ready to order. The hostess seemed annoyed and said our server will be with us shortly. Minutes go by, nobody. A server helping some customers that came after us noticed we seemed ready, smiled at us and said someone will be right with us. Again, minutes later and still nobody. My boyfriend remarked that there were several staff members hovering over one particular lady at her table. Then I overheard the same hostess that sat us down earlier tell some people that were walking in that the kitchen was closed. So was I just going to wait almost an hour just only to be told that I can't have the food that I came to the restaurant for? Some of the worst, most disorganized and careless service I've ever received. Frustrated, my boyfriend and I walked out and headed to The Island Cafe. Boy were we glad we went there! It was a cute little place, very warm relaxed atmosphere - we were sat, served and fed all within 15 minutes! They even had vegan options, much to my delight. 

In a way, I'm glad I had this experience here. The food seemed overpriced and judging by a lot of reviews, it is definitely not worth the high price tag. Also, we got to experience the loveliness of The Island Cafe! It's sad to see that this restaurant doesn't care to lose thousands of dollars (based on what has been said here on Yelp).

My wife had been here before and I wanted to check it out because we often visit Hidden Harbor next door but I had never been here before.

     We walked in and it was packed.  It's a cute place but it was so loud.  I know it was Saturday night and it can get busy but it wasn't relaxing.  We found one spot at the bar to share and we ordered some beer.  

     They have a lot of draft beers on tap but I couldn't find one that I liked.  There were a lot of IPA's and I'm not a big IPA fan.  Regardless if I had a good drink or not this place just wasn't for us.  If it wasn't as busy would it have been better?  I'm not sure.  

     Still it looks nice inside, they are busy so business is good, and a lot of people were having a good time but it just wasn't for us.  Also I didn't see a television to watch any sports too.

We walked in & 1 of the cute male bartenders was doing tricks with a couple vodka bottles. He was even breathing fire.

I didn't ride the bull. I didn't feel like upchucking that night. But it was kind of fun to watch others & cheer on strangers.

There's karaoke. I know this because my friend actually managed to get me to sing a song. I must have been really fing drunk.

The whole hotel was pretty dirty, I thought at any moment the garage elevator might break or that one day the doors would open and a hobo would be waiting inside with a knife. Also, when I arrived at 10pm, the valet was closed...umm hello..this is Vegas...nothing closes..WHY ARE YOU CLOSED??!!!???

In the past, I've usually bought shoes at Runner's Den, but I was  enticed by Road Runner's fancy foot analysis and decided to give it a try.

Bad choice. 

Ultimately, I realized the whole purpose of the foot analysis is to sell you their custom insoles, which run about $70. To me, the insoles seem like a sham. If you really need that extra support, wouldn't it be better to go to an actual foot doctor?

The lady helping me was super friendly and nice- until I told her I wasn't going to buy the insoles. The minute I told her that, her attitude and demeanor towards me changed completely. She became cold and acted if she didn't want to help me anymore. Plus, the whole experience takes forever. They only had 2 people on the floor, so from the time I walked in to the time I walked out, I was there for well over an hour- 15 minutes of that was just sitting there while no one greeted me. 

When I started getting into my longer runs, I noticed my toes were starting to hurt. I thought maybe I needed new socks, so I went to Runner's Den. The guy at Runner's Den felt my running shoes and told me they were a 1\/2 size too small. He said he usually recommends going up a 1\/2 size when you buy running shoes because your feet tend to swell when you get into longer runs, which was probably causing my pain.

Road Runner does have a generous return policy if you're a VIP member- 90 days no questions asked. I should have taken advantage of that, but honestly, I would rather go buy new shoes somewhere else at this point than go back. Other places might not have a fancy machine to measure your stride, but I guarantee you can get a better fit and service somewhere else. 

If you are going to shop at Road Runner, buy the VIP program online. It's only $1.99 for a year online instead of $20 in the store.",7,1,1

Laziza is a small restaurant with minimal seating. The idea is mostly takeout, for pre-made or ready-to-cook dishes that are displayed Subway-style on the counter.

I recently developed a love affair with falafel, so I treated myself to their falafel plate. They fill a styrofoam container to the brim with a variety of good stuff including: falafel, chick peas, fried rice, fried eggplant, fried cauliflower, and what I'll call a zesty salad for lack of a better name. So let's break it down. Obviously most of the plate didn't taste exceptionally fresh since it's not made-to-order, but it was plenty good with that in mind, and everything held up well. The fried eggplant and cauliflower were light, yet savoury. The fried rice was sufficiently seasoned and solidly average. Without question though, the highlights of the plate were the falafel (duh...) and surprisingly the salad! Please forgive me for not recalling the exact ingredients in the salad, but some notables included romaine lettuce, red cabbage, and bean sprouts. In any case, it was delightfully zesty, with inviting sweetness. Lastly, the falafel. I've had a fair bit of falafel in my life, and I can honestly say that this one was pretty unique. Once you bite through the super crispy outer shell you're exposed to a soft and unexpectedly bright green inner patty. The shell has a bit of a bold flavour, reminiscent to a samosa, while the inside greets you with a tangy twist on your generic falafel. If I had to pick between the standard falafel and this for the rest of my life, I'd go with the standard, but Laziza's variation is a welcome interpretation.

In conclusion, you'll get good fast food quality Middle Eastern food at Laziza.

The chicken plate had mashed potatoes, some greens, a chicken that was good but didn't stand out significantly to me. The veggies are raw and the mashed potatoes was my favorite thing on the plate!

I'm pretty picky when it comes to meat because I've been a vegetarian almost my entire life up until 4 years ago. My palette is just extremely picky hence the 4 stars.

The food is not gourmet but it tastes good, and the prices are reasonable. I had a 3-egg omelette (ham, cheddar, onions, mushrooms) that came with country potatoes and toast, for $6.99. The omelette was perfectly made, super tasty, and big. The potatoes were tasty, made with bell peppers and onions, however some of them were not quite cooked through and hard. 

My kids shared the ""Monster burger."" One pound (cooked) of meat, cheese, with lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion, & mayo on the side. Plus a full order of fries, all for $9.99! I felt the meat was a little bland, could have used more seasoning. But it was by no means bad or inedible. If you an eat everything on the plate (by yourself of course) you get a certificate. 

I've eaten a few things in their menu and everything was pretty good. The casino and restaurant themselves are definitely not glitzy or glamorous, but the food is good and it won't cost an arm and a leg to feed a family (or yourself after a bad night at the tables!) 

The only complaint I have is that they charge  a $2.00 fee to split a plate or box it to go, and they absolutely do NOT allow substitutions on menu items, if you want onion rings instead of fries with your burger, you pay full price for the onion rings and they bring the fries even if you ask them not to.",1,1,1

- Service and food came pretty quick, but BBQ was over-cooked, Elvis style.  Charred baby back ribs dried out.  Jerk chicken was also blackened and dry-ish.  Though some flavour managed to survive, but not even enough to trump a $5 marinade at Metro gotta say.  We ordered almost everything off the menu to try.  We tried to instagram it, but it was too blackened #truestory.  In the microcosm that is awesome restaurants in Toronto, people are just going to find better.

Also, some weirdness.

- Maybe it was just the day we came, but upon arriving, we saw the staff being berated rudely and even whapped over the head with menus by the owner.  This domestic situation was awkward to witness and lost of appetite ensued.  Staff slunk away to their stations probably trying to mitigate any further public displays.  I write this in hopes that this gets addressed.  I regret being just a bystander.

- Next, the place was pretty empty around 5pm, but we were told that the reservation list was full, which is totally fine, but in an unnecessarily attitudinal way, if that's a term.  But when said list of people did not materialize in the next half hour, we were back.  We are not normally so masochistic, just in the middle of nowhere, hungry.  So, there is def some line-up posteuring going on.

- There is one toilet for both restaurants.

- Service during eating was great--happily incongruous with the other things.  Maybe staff should find a better place to work.

Conclusion: Better to break your building rules with a DIY BBQ than trek up to mid-town nowhere and maybe (not) get a seat.  Save yourself from the light dusting of carcinogens and the echoes of Archie Bunker.",0,0,0

They took the time to answer my questions and made a point of telling me that other than my breaks the car was in great shape. I know some peoples fear with mechanics is they will tell you they found something else wrong and get you to spend more money. I didn't get the impression that they would ever do that. Again I don't know much about cars but the cost seemed reasonable to me. 640 for new rotors and break pads for all four tires for an Infiniti g35.,0,0,0

Our waiter said that the restaurant is known for their 'dinner specials' so I chose the sole with crabmeat with risotto and scallops. This dish was good.  Nice size scallops (3) and the risotto was creamy and tasty.  I wish the chef added more sauce to the fish (sauce was delicious). The crabmeat was a bit much for me atop the sole, but it wasn't bad. The presentation of the dish was executed exceptionally. You can see the kitchen staff took time to plate their dishes. Overall it's was okay, but not worth $35.  My sister ordered the chicken scalopini -sautéed onion and mushroom with white wine tomatoes and butter. This dish was good but deceiving. At a glance it seems like it's a white sauce but the plate came out and it was a red (more like marinara sauce). It was still yummy, BUT not what we were expecting.  The Caesar salad was yummy (a bit on the tart side) and the portions are huge!!!! An order of the funghi ripieni (stuffed mushrooms) was brought to our table but we sent it back.  It wasn't terrible, but not what we expected.  Very basic -stuffed with seasoned breadcrumbs and baked. Not what we were expecting, but again not horrible. 

For desert we ordered the creme brûlée and caramel pecan ice cream cake.  The creme brûlée was yummy (custard was good) but the sugar didn't caramelize right. The caramel pecan ice cream cake was meh.  Wasn't worth trying you could tell they order in bulk and keep in the freezer. 

Overall a good experience and I will for sure come back. It's a nice gem in Henderson. I love the outside lanai and the panoramic views of the city of Las Vegas.  Pretty much any seat in that restaurant is a great seat. I would stay away from the specials and order off the menu next time tho! Hope this helps!!!",1,0,0

It's Mexican, it's cheap-ish, and you know it's not gonna blow your taste buds away. I actually came in expecting it to be pretty bad but left pleasantly surprised (overall).

First of all, the waiter we had was very friendly, attentive, and funny. He was on top of drinks and refilling our margaritas despite the place being fairly busy. He commended me for being ""the first to ever finish the Los Habaneros Special"". He even rewarded me with a complimentary shot of  tequila. I do have to dock a point off because he didn't pick up the check. After waiting several minutes in a then empty restaurant (and seeing him socializing with his coworkers), I ended up taking it to the front to pay, which I usually don't mind, but I thought the waiter would be on top of this based on his excellent service before and during the meal.

The decor was expectedly loud and colorful. Traditional Latin music blaring in the background (although there was some Pitbull thrown in towards the end of the night as it was clearing out). They also had a full bar and a TV tuned into ESPN.

Onto the food.  Their free tortilla chips were warm, crunchy, and delicious. I almost couldn't stop eating them. The salsa on the other hand was very watery and bland.  As mentioned earlier, I ordered the Los Habaneros Special, which consists of a beef burrito, chili relleno, chalupa, tamale, and hard taco, served with rice and charro beans. The meal itself was expectedly nowhere near spectacular. I'm usually not a fan of tamales but found theirs surprisingly good. The taco, chalupa, and burrito were average. The chili relleno was disappointing and just tasted like spinach. The charro beans were good, not great, and the rice was fantastic but there was nowhere near enough of it.

My dinner date ordered the Monterrey Special, which is basically described as a tamale, a beef flauta, and a chicken flauta over a nacho grande type platter. Both of us having never heard of ""flautas"", we were both intrigued and she ordered it. Judging from the appetizer menu description of ""flautas"", it was a food very similar to taquitos. Upon receiving our meals, she discovered one tamale, a large bed of tortilla chips and two piles of beef and chicken. No flautas in sight. It was basically a large nacho grande with 2 different meats and 1 tamale. Not sure if something was miscommunicated along the way, but we didn't really make a stink about it because we were that hungry. The dish was still good, but if she wanted a nacho grande she would have ordered it, so they ultimately got the order wrong. She too received a very small portion of their delicious rice which was disappointing.

There was a $13.99 special for a margarita pitcher which we gladly took on. The first glass or so of our frozen strawberry banana margarita tasted great. Beyond that, it just tasted like sour mix and we forced down a couple more glasses before giving up on the rest which we were confident was mostly sour mix (probably a good 2 or 3 glasses left in the pitcher). No bueno.

Given all of these issues, the food was still satisfactory and there were no sick stomachs afterward. There aren't many Mexican places in the area so I see myself coming back if I ever have the craving.",1,0,1

So I think it will be a minute before I will ride MegaBus. On my trip out of town, the phone charger on the side of the seat did not operate.

I actually was surprised too that this particular bus was making stops before arriving to my destination. Guess I should be glad that there was only 1 stop in between my origin & destination, as this bus was making 3 other stops before its final destination to Washington, DC. 
I was also, surprised to discover that the drop location at my destination was not downtown like when I came on my last visit.

So I patiently waited but, after 30mind of waiting & bus never showed...I decided to call the 877# for an update. At which time I was informed that the bus was running behind. I asked when would the bus arrive & they said instead of 6:50pm...the bus would now be arrivjng about 8:22pm. 
My issue with this is. Over an hour delay and there was NO email or text notification that there was any delay. Which is unacceptable!

What ultimately turned me off was our service. Our young and inexperienced server had an air of superiority and unprofessionalism about him unlike anything I've seen, especially at a new\/bustling restaurant like this that probably makes many first impressions each night.

I accompanied a friend who had some stuff to sell, and though broke, was left to peruse the store while they pilfered his throw aways.
1. there is a huge range of sizes, styles and price points for their jeans - and they're all decent cuts and brands.
2. yes, the selection is way less than Buffalo's but its all good stuff. I don't care for digging jam-packed racks of used clothing if 90 percent of it sucks. This place is like someone scoured Buffalo for all the cool shit for you and presented it in a less-crowded, more inviting store.

Fair enough, except he was openly snapping at other servers. Nothing is worse then hearing a manager snap at a server for something like ice water.

Not classy, and it seemed like he had been drinking because he was talking rapidly and was sometimes slurring his words. Managers and servers should never continue to talk to their guest once they have been served. Too bad because the butter lettuce appetizer salad was one of the best we've had had in recent memory.  Just when we were about to ask him to leave, a server asked him they needed help. When asking him we could see visible anger flash through his eyes. After finally leaving we could at least enjoy the main meal. I only mention all this because this one person managed to ruin what could have been a very romantic meal. My husbands Mustard Champagne Sauce that accompanied the salmon was lovely. My Lemon Risotto could have had a little more zip to it, but overall I liked it.

I gave two stars because buying the car was relatively painless, despite me not really liking the salesman or the ""concierge service"" that got tacked on and some confusing explanations on what that exactly entitles to me.  But I'm focusing on the service:
I made an appointment online, linking from my email I received detailing that my car was recalled and I also should replace a couple filters.  The email was sent apparently because of the concierge service I have on the car.  No reminders of the made appt were sent or given afterwards, so thankfully I keep good notes on a calendar.  I show up to the dealership, and there's no good indication of where I go, but I do see a sign against the wall that says ""Service park in garage"" or something along those lines - all garage doors were shut though.  No one's in line....so I pull up and wait 15 minutes to see if someone comes out to get you.  No one does.  I'm still on-time for my appt at this point, so I get out of the car and walk into the service door - tons of guys just sitting out there, but no one was able to pop out and tell me to come on in?  Anyways, I say I have an appointment, and the guy acts confused (so I'm assuming the website didn't do what it needed to to make the appointment).  I then tell him I'm here about my recall and I needed to get the part replaced in my car.  He looks it up and tells me they're out, and they'll have to order the part.  So I just drove from the complete other end of town where I live for you to tell me that you don't have the part and I'll have to wait until it comes in?  If I was getting concierge service, couldn't they have made sure enough parts were ordered, or called me to say they didn't have it yet?  That's assuming the online appointment maker worked though, so I know, asking too much.  Then they offer to mail me a postcard when the part arrives.  Mail?  There are no faster methods of contacting me to come in to get this replacement, like email or a phone call?  I seriously have to wait for snail mail.  Ridiculous.

Perhaps it was my selection of ingredients (though my brunch companions fared no better), but my smoothie was AWFUL. Oh dear god it tasted like blueberry flavored milk... which, I realized, it pretty much was!

At home, we've been blending EVERYTHING so when the option of a smoothie presents itself, well..... it's pretty hard to resist, and actually pretty hard to ruin, but Littlefish managed to mess up three. The soy milk-balkan yogurt-banana smoothie was even worse. Perhaps milk and yogurt just don't go.

They're serving up Aboriginal and historical Canadian-inspired dishes in a cozy atmosphere with a boss wine, beer and cocktail list. Believe the hype, this place is a lovely choice for a fancy meal. Yes, it is a tad pricy, but it's definitely worth every penny. 

My party thoroughly enjoyed the deviled eggs, pierogies, mushroom salad, mussels, sweetbreads and beignet dessert. I would go into detail about the flavours, the plating, the care, but I feel I can't do it justice. So just trust. Trust that this is a haven on the ever-bro-ing Ossington strip.

The first person I encountered was awesome. She heard my vision and was like 'new to quilting? Awesome!' I was elated! Then while I was waiting for her I encountered another employee that was... Not rude but not very helpful and definitely treated me as if is as in the wrong place.

First, I was dressed down - leggings and a sweatshirt, my tattoos that are cool by my standards, no makeup, hair up - what I call Friday errand casual, I didn't have my wedding ring on and I had my extremely well behaved toddler in tow so she could have looked at me and thought ""not our client base"" BUT when she was talking to me she kept repeating how expensive, hard and not for me quilting was.

When I started explaining my idea she wasn't listening and she interrupted me twice. By the end of our time together it was obvious she didn't get my vision and had no desire to make the effort.

I tried more than once to walk away and browse alone but she stayed right with me watching me look at things and commenting about their price. Talk about annoying.

I asked for specific products and she told me multiple times how it wasn't right for me. ""Self healing mat? Oh this one is xyz dollars and its a bit expensive for you"", ""circular ruler for cutting? You could use this one but it's $xyz"", ""classes? They START at $60 BUT it requires at least a $250 investment don't you think you should think about it?""

Yeah, I do think I should think about it. Good point. Obviously you think I can't afford your products and you're treating me poorly. Talk about tacky.

So, off I went to Joann's where I found a helpful sales person to explain some basics to me after getting me to sketch my vision on paper so she understood what I was talking about. A big sale later I'm on my way to my vision.

Too bad that a small store doesn't want the business and sad that one of their employees is stuck in her idea of what quilting is and how customers should look.",16,1,0

So when my girlfriends were thinking of somewhere new to try for brunch, I suggested Sweet Peaches. 

The first time I met my friends. We did not have a reservation. I was the one had suggested we try this location. Half the restaurant being empty, we were initially told that our party of three would be seated. Then after some hmmmming and hwwwwing, we were told that we should have made a reservation because we would not actually be able to be seated.  

I was a bit taken back. If I hadn't been told we could be seated and then told it wasn't possible, it would not have stung the way it did.  It also felt that the ""advice"" to make a reservation was a little, I'm not sure how to put it, I left feeling scolded like a child.

The second time I met my girlfriends they did make an appointment. While they had additional time to sit through the slowest brunch in our history, I sadly did not. I did however enjoy a cup of coffee with my friends and the opportunity to catch up. 

Sadly my French Toast took so long to arrive that by the time it did, I was limited in my time to stay. Which is probably good because it was soggy and not at all what I anticipated in presentation from this establishment. I have it a good poking with my fork and push around. With time running out for me, service taking forever, and the food just look eh, I gave my girlfriend my share of the bill and leaves out. 

The restaurant location and experience seems to not match what I'd expect for a brunch spot with such a buzz. The restaurant is very small. Somewhat cramped.  And there is a sort of underlying unpleasant smell to the building. 

Staff didn't seem knowledgeable of the menu. (Which is frustrating when I dine because I have food allergies to some very random things that are suddenly trendy to serve.)
Personally, I think this chef has a lot to offer but the location and staff is hindering the dining experience from being phenomenal. It would be great to see Sweet Peaches expand and provide a faster, smoother meal service.",1,0,0

There's plenty of parking at the Markham civic centre itself or around the nearby buildings right across the civic centre, but that's for Friday evening. 

I went with Bad Wolf Barbeque this year after trying out gator, and some other ones from the previous ribfest around and about and it was enjoyable but could have use more barbeque sauce. The ribs were fall off the bone tender and deliciously smokey. The cut I got seemed to be on the fatty side unfortunately but that's okay, it was pretty darn good. The lines for crazy Canuck were the longest, all the ribbers are mostly the same and consistent not only in quality but in price. But for a safe bet, go to the one that has a respectable sized line for 'fresher' ribs. Prices are $24 for a full rack, $14 for a half. Share if you must!

If you don't like ribs there's still plenty of other vendors in the form of food trucks so there's plenty to choose from. Drinks are also present in lemonade, bubble tea, and coconut water.

ONE huge star deducted for the lack of the best chip truck in the world, Prince Edward's Fries which was there last year and was supposed to be there as per the ribfest site map. I'm so disappointed! Anyways, I ended up getting fries from that fries stall and they were utterly terrible. Soggy and slightly over-fried fries. Medium was $6, portion was all right albeit on the lower side. Prince Edward's they were not.

There's plenty of seating sponsored (?) by the Markham Rotary Club, who I will give a shout out to as they have certainly played or have played a big role in these and past events. There's music playing, it's a very relaxed feel there, and there's some small rides and games for the kids. It's definitely a family friendly event.",6,1,5

I went in to ask some questions and I was helped by a very nice girl who said the deal ended on Saturday 2\/15\/14. On Friday, I saw via Facebook that the deal was extended to Sunday 2\/16 and convinced my husband and a friend to do the cleanse with me on Sunday. 

Today (Saturday) I went in to purchase 2 one day cleanses. Initially, as I walk in, I see several people waiting for their drinks and food, and I am waiting at an empty register while 3 people are in the back working on orders. After about a minute, one of the girls who seems very busy and stressed says she will be right with me. No biggie, I'm not in a rush. When she gets back to the register, I order 2 one day cleanses and the stressed out girl comes off as a little rude. She says, ""well the deal ends today, so are you going to do the cleanses today?"" In my head I thought, on Facebook it says it ends Sunday, and why would I have to do the cleanse today when the juices are good for a couple days? I didn't quite get it, and I didn't think she was very friendly so I just said ""yes"". 

When I got home, I showed my husband the juices and we planned on starting the cleanse the following day. On the label of the juices, it says to consume the juice within 5 days of purchase, but as we inspect the bottles, half of the bottles have an expiration date of 5 days from today (2\/20\/14) and half have an expiration date of TODAY (2\/15\/14). Because we are concerned about getting sick from these juices, we decided to do the cleanse today even though we were not quite ready.

I give 2 stars because my first impression was not a good one, but I am willing to go back and try the smoothies because they are cheaper than other juice bars in the area. BUT I will not recommend this place to anyone unless my next experience is a good one. My suggestion to Nekter is to make sure they have enough people working on a Saturday so that the workers are not stressed and can be friendly at all times. I also suggest that they are consistent with the deals\/advertisements they have on social media, and to make sure they're not giving old juices while telling people they can start the cleanse a few days after purchasing it.

_______________________________________________________________
*******UPDATE:
My husband posted on Nekter's facebook about the bottles having different expiration dates and they said ""we apologize as all bottles should expire the same day - we would be glad to give you new bottles to compliment the others. thank you!""  SO my husband goes to exchange the expired bottles, the girl he talked to did not want to help him and said that the cleanse is supposed to be completed the day of purchase (although their website says different) and that is why the bottles expired that same day. He tells her that he was told that all of the bottles should have the same expiration date and she says ""well you must have spoken to someone in California because we do things differently in Arizona"". Really?! After going back and forth, she finally gives in.  I would have given them an extra star for fixing the problem right away, but it was such a frustrating experience, that I've decided to take one off. We will not be returning.

I'm usually skeptical of people who give a place 1 star - I mean how bad could it have been if a sophisticated Yelper went there in the first place, right?  But I have NO idea how this place has 4 stars: there is nothing special AT ALL about the food, the service was pretty poor, and the prices are outrageous.  I've figured out why people go here - there's very little sushi competition in Vegas.  But that doesn't mean it deserves 4 stars.  I think Vegas restaurants must beget a chicken-head lemming syndrome (i.e. girls who didn't pay for the meal highlighting that they have wealthy boyfriends who take them to Vegas headline spots in order to impress their ""friends"" on Yelp).  I hope I'm wrong, but I don't think I am.

A group of us ordered a wide variety of a ton of food there this past weekend for dinner on Saturday night.  I personally tried a few pieces from the Chef's sashimi selection, the braised pork belly, and a couple rolls (crab dynamite and tempura shrimp).  The fish was fresh and tasty, but that's to be expected right?  To me, that's just securing fresh inventory via reliable transportation, so the credit should go to the inventory buyer, not the chef.  While I realize that rolls are the good-intentioned, but unaccomplished cousin in a good sushi restaurant, shouldn't they be pretty easy to make fairly enjoyable?  These were entirely forgettable.  The pork belly was well prepared from a cooking standpoint, but was gaudily overseasoned with ginger, which everone knows can easily overpower a dish.

Another point that irked me was that we made a 9:30PM reservation after a Cirque show.  We showed up early, waited an hour, then were given 2 separate tables for 12 people, despite having requested one large table for our group.  We declined the two tables and waited a while longer to be seated at a clearing large table.  I usually don't mind being split up, but in this case ppl had flown from all over the country to meet in Vegas 1 year after graduating from b-school - we wanted to sit together, and weren't asked about being split up.

The food took FOREVER to order and FOREVER to come.  The waitstaff noticed how long it took, so they brought our group 4 free desserts, which was a nice gesture, but only delayed them bringing the check and prolonged a dinner that took 3.5 hours and killed the rest of our night in which we were planning to drop in on a lounge.

To summarize:
Minus one star: Food flavor
Minus one star: Service (our servers had great attitudes, but at a place like this, execution is what counts, not intentions)
Minus one star: Value (I don't mind paying a premium for great food, service, and overall experience...but this wasn't any of those)
Minus one star: overall poor experience from waiting one hour despite being early for our reservation to having post-dinner plans nixed due to slow service.

We arrived around 1 pm on a Saturday. There was one party awaiting a table ahead of us. We asked for patio seating, and even though several tables were visibly unoccupied, they told us to wait 10 minutes because ""they had lots of tables that needed to be wiped down."" 

Once seated, we were promptly greeted by a waiter who asked the now-standard question: have you been here before?

(WHY DOES THAT MATTER?? Unless there is some secret to navigating your menu that 30-plus years of restaurant dining hasn't prepared me for (is the sushi arriving on a boat or being served off a naked body? Do I have to cook anything myself? Are any foodstuffs on offer not actually legal?), you don't need to ask this. You just handed me a two-sided menu with all-text graphics. BIG BLOCK LETTERS THAT SAY BURGERS HERE FRIES HERE WINE HERE. Numbers that equal dollars I will trade you for burgers.  You are the waiter equivalent of that office d-bag who reads every slide of his PowerPoint. Don't be that waiter.)

I asked to build my own burger. Before I finished saying that, the waiter explained that they have a special right now with their plain burger that you can add three toppings. OK, that would have been a more suitable preamble than ""here's how menus work."" I chose to upgrade to the ""American-style Kobe beef"" and chose roasted peppers and avocado (there aren't really very many topping options for those avoiding dairy, so I couldn't find a third). We also ordered fries to share, which they offered to bring out before our burgers. 

The fries were good. I don't like salty, so they were fine by me. Most people would probably add salt. 
The burger was ..meh. I think shredded lettuce is gross and kind of down-market. The burgers were the big, tall kind that photograph great in magazines like Texas Monthly but that don't actually fit in mouths. For my money, I'd just as soon eat at Smashburger.

We met up with Arvin C., Christina W, and David S. and Zumba'd for 60 minutes straight. A few things I liked were that there was space to get your groove on. You didn't feel  claustrophobic like a can of sardines and the instructor had steps you could pick up fairly easily although I looked like a rookie standing beside all of the regulars in the class.

That being said, it's pretty hard to mess up pizza. However, I want to take this time to congratulate Slice for accomplishing this daunting task. 

Maybe it had something to do with the fact that it took a little under an hour and a half to arrive and was cold and hard as a rock when I opened the box. Flavorless and difficult to chew. Almost inedible. I'm tempted to compare it to pizza flavored cardboard, but that would be an insult to pizza flavored cardboard. 

They were closed by the time I tried to call and discuss the ""pizza"" that they had delivered, so I can't comment on their customer service.

Yummy on the Cinnamon crisp and double yummy on the blueberry cheese danish. I assumed the service would be friendly, I mean, after all, how can you be crabby when you work with frosting all day. And I was right. Each time I've been, they've been sweet as sugar and always offer a free sample.

It was 3 minute walk from Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel, the oldest Church in Old Montreal. Since I was craving for crepes, my husband and I decided to try this restaurant after we visited that church. 

The restaurant was not fancy and the furniture was old-fashioned. Since we were Asians, the servers did not put a lot of attentions to us (we had an impression that the servers didn't like Asians since they just spend time talking to either locals or Caucasians.) We ordered a Crepe Suzette (crepe served with a delicious orange sauce, Grand Marnier and Cognac), a French onion soup and a mocha. We were surprised the portion was very big in terms of the money we spent. That was probably the best crepe we have ever tried. I am always afraid of food with strong orange scent (since it reminds me of the smell of garbage chute for some reason), but here, the crepe was just perfect, you can taste the hint of orange flavor but it won't be too over.

I called around 3 and booked an appointment for 5pm and they were able to accommodate us. We arrived close to 15 minutes early but they took us in basically right away, which was great. They had about 6 pedicure chairs set up alongside one another - the comfortable massage chairs with the sinks underneath.
The pedicure was great! My feet are soft, nails are clean and nicely painted - overall a job well done. We requested paraffin, which was great and well worth the extra $10. I guess my pedi used up all of the paraffin and the woman doing my moms feet actually went through a lot of trouble to melt some wax for my mom to get her paraffin. It took about 15 extra minutes but we didn't mind the wait (we are serious about our paraffin!). 
The woman doing my moms pedicure (Ann) was very thoughtful and patient. My mom has very sensitive feet and she did a great job of being careful to not hurt her, taking time and being aware of anything that might cause pain. I really appreciated that and wouldn't hesitate to go back and see her. 
My pedicure was a little rushed and she actually did a manicure in between my paraffin (which I didn't mind because I wasn't in a hurry). 
The pedicures are only $28. Well worth the money. I think we will definitely be back!",4,0,0

The Soap Opera is one of my very few all time favorite stores in Madison.  I literally walk in there every time I am on State St, and that is saying something.  I love the variety of cute bath stuff, and makeup, and Italian toothbrushes and whatever else.  Plus, even when you walk by, the clean soapy smell of the store is pretty irresistible.  And who would want to resist creating their own custom scented shampoo and matching conditioner and lotion?

It all started when I was brought back by a guy whom I figured was the dr to only learn 30 minutes after talking with him he was just an assistant. Ok no big deal but still don't know his name. Then i said multiple times when making the apt and when I got there filling out paperwork I was there for glasses exam and only that. I guess the guy ran all the tests for contacts and was pretty annoyed when I said after I don't need contacts. I was clearly there for glasses obviously I was wearing my glasses while there. Then this is what pisses me off I drove and told them I can't have my eyes dilated because I have to drive myself back home. This guy says it won't mess with my vision. But I couldn't see I even stuck around for a good two hours in town just so I didn't  have to trek 30minutes back home blind.  THEN I WAS LEFT IN A ROOM FOR 30 minutes for literally no reason the dr came in tried to convince me to get LASIK surgery said not interested then hand me my script and I was free to leave. WHY THE HECK DID THAT TAKE SO LONG. ALSO THE GIRLS AT THE FRONT DESK ARE VERY UNHELPFUL. asked where the women glasses are located only seen men's and kids. Never got an answer.

Finally get a text message and we got two bays but they were away from eachother (which sucked) it was another 1-2 hours wait to get side by side. No dramas we just made do with what we had. What really annoyed me and reason for my low rating. We just waited 90 min was told only 20-40 min and really wanted booths side by side. We were put way apart and the guy didn't tell us about an additional $5 each person needs to pay, nor did he say having 16 people, you would need 3 booths not 2, I think the staff just assume you know the rules and how it's all done. Anyways, one of the bay's worked, the other bay the computer was stuffed for another half an hour, by then we were just completely over it and got drunk spent over a grand on alcohol and food anyways.

Bristo Square is owned by the University of Edinburgh and being next to several uni buildings, it is usually a popular gathering point for students, and on sunny days makes a nice eating area. At weekends it attracts a lot of skaters and rollerbladers, and crossing the Square can become a touch precarious. At all times it also seems to attract more colourful, jolly visitors (some might call them drunks). Though the juxtaposition with these two groups is often amusing. At weekends it can also fill up with students from nearby student union Teviot, or other nearby pubs. But don't be put off! With McEwan Hall nearby this is an easy tourist spot to just drop by.

During the summer it becomes a festival venue and as Matthew mentions, it houses the every popular E4 sponsered Underbelly tent.",0,0,0

There are also partitions between sets of tables and high walls which separates every group.  It feels more personal and more intimate.  Area wise, there are bigger seating space and there is a bigger bar area which is perfect.  Hard Rock Cafe bar area is just too small for those waiting for their tables.

It took me several months before I actually went to see the castle itself, and it's a lovely ol' ruin! It's a historically important piece of architecture (which others can tell you about much more aptly than I can) and you can pretty much just wander right in when it's open. It's not as well-preserved as Edinburgh Castle, nor as spectacularly placed, but it's beautiful in its own way, and you get good views from its walls! Did I mention it's free?! (at least no one tried to take my money when I went there...)

The park itself has a great variety of spaces, as I've mentioned, and for such a small place has a surprising number of ""oh, I had no idea THAT was there!"" routes and paths. I've recently discovered some great Blackberry bushes, so if you're into making jams and chutneys, that's another mark in the park's favour!

Remember when you'd go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months you'd go back and have it all again? Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie

I can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.

Now here comes the bad:

1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor\/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.

2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.

3. Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.

It's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low. Part of me hopes it gets better, but like an absentee father it'll just let me down again.",3,2,0

I walked up to check in and they told me I had to get in line to check in?? I said can't I just check in and wait at the bar. NOPE. They don't open the doors until 5. Seems to me I'd open at 4 and get some cocktail revenue. Plus, wouldn't it be just as easy and more polite to just check me in? But hey, what do I know. They were pretty snooty and I don't know why. Bet they don't make enough to eat there. So I stand in line like an asshole and wait. Then at 5 she yells out who has a reservation.

Food-
Brown butter tortellini $20  it was ok
Beef Wellington $54 which is the signature dish. You can only get it rare, but it is baked so it isn't bloody for us medium eaters. The Wellington itself was pretty good. I hated the sauce it was floating in. It tasted like something from NASA. The root vegetables were fantastic! All 2 bites of them. 
Creamed spinach $12 was pretty yummy. 
Filet $78 She ordered it medium and I swear it was going to moo. She sent it back and it returned exactly the same. She ended up not eating it and taking it to go
Sticky toffee pudding $14 for dessert. Good. 
French press coffee $12 that came with chocolate spoons That was the highlight of the meal. A must have. 
One Beaujoulais wine $12
One antioxidant cocktail $14

On the menu it says, Every Server is Your Server. Totally true. Super nice waitstff, bus staff, hosts ... and everyone is genuinely helpful and never looks put upon if you ask them a question as they walk by your table. We brought all four kiddos to breakfast so I was totally skeptical about the ability to leave unscathed - or at least not have patrons throwing things at us - but really the attentiveness of the waitstaff made this experience seamless.

For food, this is almost a 4 simply because their array of GLUTEN-FREE items is unsurpassed in Charlotte. When I quietly asked about gluten-free options, the waiter rattled off a variety of options with ease. I wanted to cry when they asked if I wanted white or multi-grain toast with my breakfast. Toast is not something I have EVER been offered at a restaurant. Toast has gluten-free pancakes - they were so good that I thought maybe they made a mistake and gave my daughter the regular ones. Nope. They're just legitimately delicious. My other daughter ordered gluten-free French Toast. Yes. French Toast. Gluten-free. Delicious. 

As for the rest of the menu ... I ordered the southwest egg scramble off the specials - it was pretty good. What killed it for me was the cold hash browns piled on top. Had I opted to replace the hash browns with a side of fruit, my experience would have been totally different. The hashbrowns were simply large chunks of lightly seasoned potatoes. Even if they were hot, I doubt that I would have liked them. Thankfully, my 7 year old polished off his combo plate and gladly took my hash browns off my hands. Unfortunately, we also ordered a side of hash browns for the girls to share. Also very cold. Kind of a bummer. 

At the end of the day, the service was amazing, the food was pretty good, the gluten-free options were astounding, and our bill was $68 ... but only because it was too early for me to order a bloody.

Came here for Winterlicious! We did not have a reservation so it took about 1 hour and 45 minutes to get seated but I was determined to try this place out because it was one of the very few itallian places I wanted to go to.

We got the end seat at the bar close to the kitchen and our server was really delightful to speak to. I didn't get his name unfortunately but he wasn't itallian but his pronunciation of the dishes were endearing!

We ordered all the appetizers because we had the choice of two which was Polenta, Testa, Barbabietole, Cicoria, the mains were Ammazza Fegato and Caponata con Cavolfiore, and we also had another choice of two for the dessert and had them all: Pizelle, Torta Cioccolatino, Amaretti Arancione, and Cantuccino.

Me and my friend also ordered drinks: Gassosa Speziata & La Vita Nuova. The Gassosa Speziata was a house made grapefruit, tamarind, clove soda that was delightfully strong. The La Vita Nuova was a lovely cocktail with bacardi rum that i thoroughly enjoyed with my dishes :)

 Below I listed them in the order we recieved them.

Polenta (4\/5) 
They were crispy and deliciously spicy but I felt they were too oily.

Testa (5\/5)
Fried Pig Head was so good in terms of flavour, sweet and spicy, but very decadent in terms of fat.

Cicoria (4\/5)
The roman dandelions were bitter and lightly tossed in the vinegrette which was a refreshing palate cleanser for the previously two oily starters.

Barbabietole (5\/5)
The dessert of the starters; it was naturally sweet with the stracciatella so lovely.

Ammazza Fegato (4\/5)
Was expecting alot more farro than recieved but the tuscan offal sausage was to die for dipped in the runny yolk so I guess that made up for it.

Caponata con Cavolfiore (2.5\/5)
Just regular cauliflower in butter and little bits of pork here and there with cheese, maybe its just me because I'm not European or well versed in their food culture but it was pretty average for me.

Pizelle, Torta Cioccolatino, Amaretti Arancione, and Cantuccino (4\/5) 
We ordered a coffee with the desserts and we were given Expresso Infused Sugar as well as regular sugar and cream. The dessert platter was nice I really loved all of them except the Cantuccino. Each of them had their unique flavour and aromas and complimented each other but the biscotti was just there lol.

Overall enjoyed the experience but probably not looking to come back; a must try for bar food itallian style :)",0,0,0

Sides: 
Mac & Cheese had jalapeños in it. That is not standard. When something is not standard, it should be listed on the menu or told to you when you order. I got home and no one ate it because of that. It also had something red in it. 

Potato salad had olives in it. That is not standard. While one person thought it was awesome, all others thought it was not good at all and didn't eat it. I thought it was awful. 

Beans and greens tasted like they were right out of a can. Not good... cornbread was average. 

The sides ruined it for me. I couldn't get pass that. The sauce was average also. 

The good: Service, meat (pulled pork & brisket)

The excellent: Desserts (banana pudding and peach cobbler)

I know it seems like it should have more stars, but the non standard potato salad and Mac & Cheese without letting me know totally ruined it for me. I do hope that they will have a successful business.",1,1,0

I understand that turbulence is normal. But I would rather you cancel another flight because it is too dangerous to fly, then to put passengers through the scariest flight of their lives.

Walking in to the old church converted to a restaurant was cool.  The place was decorated well and had some great old tables and chairs.  heck, even the booths looked like they were made from the old church pews. Upon arrival our friends were waiting at the bar for us as we were about 5 minutes late (my brother in-law decided to show up late for his surprise birthday party)  and were seated immediately.

This next song is called ""Waiting"". (look up Stephen Lynch ""Waiting"" if you never heard it).

We waited forever for our drink orders to be taken and we really needed this dinner not to be a long dragged out affair.  We had tickets for the comedy club and did not want to be late.  So we waited and waited and finally we flagged down our waitress for drink orders.

After the drinks arrived we waited again.  Finally we ordered our appetizers and the waiting game began again to order our entrees.  After about 15 minutes and myself looking at my watch a whole bunch we got our appetizers and ordered our entrees. 

The appetizers were good.  We ordered the caprese salad and it was good except it lacked the Balsamic Vinegar.  We finally asked for this and they brought it to us to add outselves.

Now the salads that came with everybody's meals was a different story.  3 our of the 7 of us had some sort of sand or grit in their salads as if the lettuce had not been washed.   I even sampled their salads and yes...it felt like somebody kicked sand in my mouth from the beach.

Finally the entrees came out and I am not a huge pasta lover so I ordered the pizza and it was VERY good.  I was a bit surprise on this and enjoyed my pizza very much.  Was it is best ever...nah but it could be in the top 15 on my list.   But overall everyone in our ground enjoyed their meals and it was good.

LET THE WAITING GAME BEGIN AGAIN!  We finished out meals and just sat and waited for our checks.  Wait, wait, wait, and finally a friend of mine grabs the waitress and asked for the check as we were already late for our show.  Ultimately the dinner took about 30 minutes longer than what we had thought and could have easily been resolved with better service and a more attentive wait staff.

So the food was good and the service sucked.  I would go back to the Belinni as it was good but should remember that it will take all night and we should not have other plans.  

On a side note:  They should have some sort of sign exiting the building to ""watch you step"" as I missed a little step immediately out their door and almost fell down the additional steps.",1,2,0

They have lunch menu that is pretty affordable but all plates served are 4 oz. I ordered the prime rib eye and seafood plate (baby scallops, salmon, yellowtail, one muscle, and butterflied shrimp). Each plate comes with a side of vegetables (Napa cabbage, green onions, tofu, mushrooms, and carrots) with udon and a bowl of rice. 

QUALITY:
I wasn't impressed. The beef slices tasted slightly gamey and it didn't hold a bright red color like I've seen with other shabu shabu\/kbbq places. I was not a fan of the baby scallops, especially for the price. The one muscle looked like it was frozen prior as well as everything else probably. If I could, I would easily replace them with more muscles. The shrimp and fish were fresh though. However, I did think it was odd that the fish were served as sashimi slices. I ended up eating them as sashimi. 

Usually, the broth of any post shabu meal should be taken home because it tastes bomb AF but I didn't because the broth didn't have that deep broth-y taste. In the beginning, I felt like the broth was weak and I had hoped that by the end of my meal, the broth would taste better, but that didn't happen. 

PRICE: 
For the lunch menu, the plate of prime rib eye was about $11 and the seafood was about $15. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
My waiter was nice and checked in with me frequently. Despite the fact that he accidentally brought me regular miso broth instead of spicy miso broth and charging me for extra udon instead of the free bowl of rice, he had nothing to do with my low review. 

ENVIRONMENT:
The decor is a bit outdated. I think if this place did a bit of remodeling and updating of the menu, they would have more business (during the prime time of lunch on a Sunday, there were only two tables - me and another couple).

Overall, I would not come back due to the quality of food.",1,0,0

The portions are good, the flavor was alright. There were way more rice & noodles in the main than the actual meat\/veg. For dine-in, but still put in to-go container, there're 2 small dessert taro cakes, tested more like sweet potato cake to me. 

Personally like the one across more. This one's flavor is less flavorful and not enough meat\/veg. And this one is pricier.",0,0,0

I had heard several stories of women who suffered from severe hair loss after getting the procedure done, so I was very on the fence. I came in for a consultation with Kelly and he assured me that hair loss wouldn't be an issue. He was very honest about the results, and didn't romanticize or over glamorize the procedure at all. I decided to set up an appointment with him for the blowout. He was very, very nice and kind. He's very calm and patient. I am extremely happy with my results, as well as the service I received at the salon. I will definitely be going back for all my hair and beauty needs. If you are contemplating whether or not to get a blowout done, or debating whether or not to go to the salon in general, GO. I highly recommend it. It is an experience you will not regret. Although the ambiance and decoration seems ""punk-rock,"" the service is A+. I recommend going to Choppers Hair Salon to anyone. Kelly was extremely professional and did an amazing job.",0,0,0

I just wanted a cake even if it was not chocolate but nope, they didn't have something like that unless you wanted to buy a whole loaf of what they call a sort of chocolate souffle.  That is what I ended up doing.  When paying, I was offered a sample of a brownie.  And it was so gross.  It was like burnt and hard at the bottom and truthfully the rest was just bad.

Upon moving in, our quoted 1250 rent went up to 1350, plus a community ""gas"" bill, note we only used the grill once in the year we lived there. Forthcoming, we were usually late on our rent because my fiancé got laid off, in trying to figure it out, they wouldn't budge with us. Instead, they added 30 dollars after every day we were late. We found more than 5 scorpions in our apartment. They came and ""sprayed"" and we still had an issue, on top of the cockroaches and ear wigs. We were falsely accused for having glass by the pool. When we called them out, they reviewed their tapes and said they were wrong but we never got an apology. Every time I went into the office, Tonya was extremely rude to me. Upon moving out, she told me that we better leave our keys or we won't be able to afford the cost of them. I had already given her my keys, key fob and everything else.

The decor of this place is funny because it doesn't exactly scream Asian or Oriental.  The restaurant I think used to be a steak house of some sort and it shows.  The colors and everything kinda remind you of a log cabin.  Talk about confusing!  You'd think you were going to have some kind of Asian fusion cuisine.  Unfortunately it's far from anything like that.  Service is ok, fast on refills for your drinks, just don't expect lots of smiling faces and casual banter.  

I've been there for lunch a few times and it's just good enough to maybe get you full.  The food is standard of what you would find in lots of Chinese buffets here in Vegas, Beef Broccoli, Won Tons, Egg Drop Soup, Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef, salad bar, sushi bar, and a tiny dessert bar.  Of course you have your required Cheese Pizza here at the restaurant (which is always very cheesy), and there is a stir fry station where you can concoct your own creation and that's not too bad.  There are a few different items there, such as Fried Frog Legs.  They have these Fried Chicken Wings which are excellent (I think because of the sprinkling of MSG afterwards) especially with a squeeze of lemon, and a dip in some ketchup.  Just make sure to get them while they are fresh out of the oil and piping hot.  

If you eat lunch on the weekend at Pacific Buffet it's an all day dinner menu so you do get things like New York Steak, oysters, and crab legs.  However, the rest of the standard fare is well....just standard.  The quality for me just isn't there!  And I have low standards at a Chinese buffet!  Most of the food is mediocre, and often times it tastes like it's been sitting there under the heat lamp just a little bit too long.  And don't get me started on the sushi station.  I get a wee bit scared when your sushi is just a shade over room temperature.  Salmonella, start your engines!  Just not my thing.  If you're going to eat here keep an eye out for the freshest trays of food that come out from the kitchen, it's your best bet.  If all the food was rotated more often, I could see the ratings go up a bit.  

We continue to go there only because it is the closest Chinese buffet to our place.  The prices are reasonable, around $7 for lunch on weekdays and $11 for dinner.  Saturday and Sunday is all day dinner menu for $11.  Drinks will set you back a little over $1 per person.  It's funny because they have had their 'Grand Opening' sign outside their doors and it's been almost a year now since they've been open.

Dolce Wraps is awesome because they offer a mix of traditional Mediterranean food and other stuff, using their sauces to offer different flavors. There is something for everyone, including picky eaters and vegetarians!

As the name would imply, the wraps are what they are known for. They put them together then grill them (!!!) making the pita wrap all nice and toasty. My favorites are the chicken curry salad wrap, chicken hummus wrap, chicken\/lamb Moroccan wrap.

Other good options are the lentil and rice salad and the falafel salad. 

Speaking of falafel - THEY MAKE IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. Fresh, fried ground chickpea goodness.

The customer service is iffy. One time, my husband and I went right when we got home from our honeymoon (yes, we missed it that much), and they gave us a free dessert. Other times, my wrap is not even close to what I ordered. Tip: if you have a custom order, watch them make it so they get it right. It's usually when you go off-menu that they get it wrong (and then get a little snippy with you).

Super disappointed, when I opened my light-weighted take out box the extremely tiny little servings of the rice awfully surprised me. I didn't expect to have a this small dinner.

Despite the not so pleasant appearance of the dish, the food is average. I did like the sticky texture of the rice with cheese. There were just two or three pieces of small Unagi.

I think I would recommend people rather go to the restaurant to have meals. I think the mood of the restaurant (bar style?) would satisfy some of us. Also, I would say the restaurant expected us to order a lot of food and that's why they are in such a ""really small"" plate. 

That would be great if only my Unagi rice was placed in a smaller container or box, so that it would be appeared as appetizing and more delicious to me in my opinion.

Thursday night my coworker and I came down stairs to pay for the renaming balance on his card so by Friday I can just leave. I checked my account Friday and both hold transactions of $150 and $65 was released.
 
Saturday comes around and I got charged for $150 plus $65. I called the front desk and I told her what had happened and she said ""it's the system, we have nothing to do with it"" ""the money will be refunded in 7 to 10 business days"".

(As per the other more negative reviews, you will want to avoid the Americanized food and you'll be fine.) In my experience, I have found the lady in charge to be somewhat bipolar. It definitely helps if you can speak Cantonese yourself and hold a conversation with her. A couple times I communicated exclusively in Cantonese and she was quite happy to help us and recommend orders. Another time, I was talking with a friend in Mandarin and switched to Canto when ordering, though she kept replying coldly in Mandarin and didn't really pay much attention to us during our meal. Maybe she was just having a bad day.

Service aside, their food is quite good. It is somewhat pricey, but this is true of their authentic Chinese counterparts as well (think Rose Tea, Sichuan Gourmet, and Hunan Bar). You'll want to try some dishes not found in these other places; their Specials menu is a good place to start. We once had a pork ribs with purple leaves (sorry for the poor translation), and the pork was delicious, all cooked up to the right point before getting burnt. Other nice dishes include various Chinese vegetables such as pea shoots or Chinese spinach, and barbecued meats such as roast duck or the roast pork pot.",3,3,1

While the food was all cooked well enough, the restaurant was disgusting! I'll preface the following comments by saying I'm not a germaphobe, not a picky person about dirt, etc - almost the opposite. Often times my husband will say ""aren't you going to wash your hands??"" when I hadn't thought about it. 

Walking in there was a slight odor, but not terrible, just like dirty carpet. When we were seated in our booth and handed menus I immediately noticed that there was butter or grease on the back of my menu and the pages of my husband's stuck together from something sticky. The table also felt a bit sticky, but with those sealed wood tables that happens even when clean sometimes depending on what they use to clean. When I asked the waitress for a new menu she brought me one that wasn't much better, clearly they never get wiped down. The outside of my glass was sticky, perhaps from the drink spilling over when being filled, but that also should have been wiped down because my hands felt sticky the entire meal. The glass just looked dirty. I will say, with everything else the silverware was at least clean.

The booth we were in was next to a faux log wall and you could tell the log wall hadn't been dusted in months, if ever. The ledges between booths and under the murals and the lighting fixtures were also covered in dust. I'm sure if we were sat near the Knick knacks and rising gear those also would have been dusty. It was very apparent that cleanliness wasn't a priority in the dining area, which naturally raises concerns about the kitchen.

With the slightly higher prices, just OK food, and dirty\/sticky\/dusty dining area I'm not surprised that the larger Texas Roadhouse literally across the street had a 30 min wait while there were more empty than filled tables at the Texas Land & Cattle. Next time, and all future times, we'll take the wait.",2,1,0

The veggie omelet was also pretty standard. All your typical vegetables and nothing stand-out-ish. Not the worst one I've ever had, but I wouldn't say it was the best.

8npSa-OGMHOXuC1FHL2rxQ,Nh75diBuPgSSBMNoT5IGDA,j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg,5,2011-02-20,"remember Angelina Jolie when she was married to Billy Bob?  It's been a long time because the now refined philanthropist\/mother-of-Jolie Pitt-clan\/paparazzi-shy-actress does not at all resemble the Angelina of those times: controversial, grungy, and FUN.  Ichiza is like that old Angelina, plus delicious!

Atmosphere is not for the timid eater, you are likely to share tables with strangers, you may even have to share tables with strangers as well as be shoes-less with them.  But if you like making friends over sake and exotic meats & fish, then come on in, order a drink and start staring... not at other people - at the strips of paper glued to the walls on which much of the menu is written (most of them are far away, so you will end up seeming like you're staring at other patrons anyways)!  Did I mention this restaurant was not for the shy?  

The current Angelina does not seem to eat, but the old one did, and she probably devoured things like chicken gizzards (skewered and stir-fried), beef liver, & beef tongue, all of which are tasty at Ichiza.  My personal favorites are the buttery beef tongue and the chewy skewered gizzards.  

If the present Ms. Jolie did eat, she'd probably enjoy the tofu and sashimi salad: refreshing cold tofu and top quality fish over fresh romaine and avocado, with zesty sesame vinagrette, it's approved for anorexic starlets.

Okay, all Angelina talk aside, I love Ichiza the most because of the grain epiphany that happened to me at this hole-in-the-wall Japanese treasure: the broiled rice balls - the best thing to have happened to anyone that's a fan of slightly-burned crispy rice.  It was these balls (not the Angelina fantasy - sorry to disappoint some of you) that made me an Ichiza convert.",8,7,6

Argh ok..I'm sort of on the fence about what to rate this place. I have had two good experiences here now, but that doesn't mean that I think it's worth more stars. I do think 2.5\/5 stars is more accurate rating. When I've been here, I had fun, but I don't think it had much to do with the club itself and I honestly don't think this place has much going for it. Here is why:

- Cover is too expensive ($20 after 11 on a crowded night) unless you arrive early enough that the whole place will still be empty and therefore not much fun. I am willing to pay more for a much nicer club or a better DJ or special event. Guestlist usually doesn't do anything unless you get there really early, as I have learned the hard way, especially if it is busy.

- Drinks were expensive ($6.25) for how small they are and compared to other places nearby, and the bartenders kept trying to get us to buy a bottle (both times I was there, party of 3 and party of 4) which FYI is not a good deal. Especially if you're not getting a booth for it!

- Big clubs like this tend to not care about people, because they are so big and are well-known so they know they will fill up to sell out every night regardless of how they treat you. This means they don't do much to help you out, like honouring guest list or line bypass etc. as they know it's not going to cost them if they lose a few customers.  

- The bathrooms are co-ed on the main floor. Personally I have no problem with this, but I know tons of other people who might. Plus it makes it easier for people to hook up..sounds like fun no?

- The bouncers were really annoying about how we traveled around the place, they would only let us use one specific staircase which made it really crowded there and we had to walk all the way around the place for what seemed like no reason.",2,0,1

So when the food arrived, we were pleased and dug into it immediately. One bowl of ramen with fish balls and another bowl of ramen with a fried and sliced chicken breast. I thought mine was just fine, but Mom insisted that hers was too salty to enjoy. We sent it back. The waiter said that the chef added some hot water to it and it certainly was improved vastly.

My brother and I were wandering ""downtown"", stumbling from one casino to the other, and decided to step through the doors of Main Street to use the indoor street overpass (we were trying to find the ""chicken"" to get to the bus to get back to the strip). 

As we looked around we saw a sign advertising $1.50 micro-brews at the casino bar (be sure to use the casino bar, as for some reason the bar in the casino's Triple 7 restaurant does not have the special, I guess it's because you don't have video poker machines in front of you there - see photos). 

So we plop down at the bar and learn there is not one micro-brew, but 5! We drank a couple pints of the various offerings and enjoyed them all.

Since I love pretzels, I was imagining all sorts of delights.  Hard pretzels in knots, twists, and rods covered with the finest chocolate.  Freshly baked soft pretzels salted, or rolled in cinnamon and sugar, or butter and garlic.  You name it.  They were going to sell it.

Well I was sorely disappointed.  Upon entering, I realized this is probably more of a mail order type business.  No soft pretzels, either.  They specialize in pretzels dipped in chocolate and topped with nuts, candy pieces, etc.  There were some boxes of pretzels already made up, and we purchased a few.  The honey wheat pretzel rods were actually pretty good, the small bite-sized pretzels were nothing special.  The chocolate was a nice quality, but not the best.  

Although they hand dip all the pretzels, they do not make the actual pretzels.  So if you're on a local foods kick, which I'm not, this isn't the place for you.  Not bad to have around the house and for gifts to pretzel lovers or corporate gifts as they are better than the products you would find in most grocery stores.

We came here because our friends had ordered the Lechon for Thanksgiving and we really liked it and thought the restaurant would have some delicious treats for us. The place was easy to find, but when we got there, no one greeted us and we had to find the server. Once we were seated and looked over the menu, I asked about a special drink they had listed, but wasn't available so I ordered water. I ordered oxtail soup while my boyfriend ordered the shrimp pancit. 10 mins later we were finally served our drinks. Then almost 15 mins from the time we ordered our server informed us that they were out of shrimp. I suggested my boyfriend order something else all together... but the server told us the pancit was already being made... so we settled for pork. My oxtail soup came out first. I could hardly wait. But my palate tasted nothing extraordinary... if I could describe the taste in color it would be a boring gray... the oxtail's mild taste was thrown off by watered down broth. It almost brings me to tears as I write this, such a waste of good meat. The pancit joined us about 5 minutes later. I can almost make up excuses for bad oxtail since it takes so long to prepare... but there is absolutely no excuse to have bad pancit... And the pancit noodles where great... but what the hell were they thinking? Hard pieces of non-edible pork was riddled amongst the flavorful yummy pancit... WTF it was so horrible. But the final blow to our meal time experience was  the check... my boyfriend had though he ordered the solo meal pancit.. but instead was charged for the family size. There was no conformation from the sever and granted, the boyfriend didn't specify he wanted the solo meal... but come on this is suppose to be a professional business and I am sure this hasn't only happened to my boyfriend.  Instead of correcting and complaining we left, disappointed and curious as to why this place has sure high marks.

The Japanese restaurants around here primarily center around either sushi or hibachi. When their menus do have ramen on them, it is usually the frozen prepackaged type. There are plenty of Vietnamese restaurants serving pho close to downtown, but ramen is a completely different animal. 

Having read the other reviews, my expectations were tempered. I didn't expect it to be the authentic hakata or sapporo style ramen that I had when I was in Las Vegas that cost $7 for a large bowl and inspired me to spend 2 months developing a recipe to satisfy my new obsession.

Here's a synopsis of what we had:

Takahachi Raman - If it wasn't for the garlic, this wouldn't have much of any taste. The shredded pork becomes a tangled mush in the soup.

Fried Chicken and Ramen - I didn't get any sense of fried chicken in the soup. Maple syrup and hot sauce on fried chicken is always a good combination, but the breading and the chicken itself was not seasoned. The leg piece is a a bad accompaniment with a dish that you eat with chopsticks and a spoon.

Ohio Beef Brisket and Matzo Ramen - This one was the most disappointing. The beef was good, but the broth had almost no taste. The matzo ball was flavorless, extremely dense, surprisingly cold and I had to spit it out. When I got home that night, I made my own matzo ball soup from scratch in the hopes of forgetting this travesty.

Pork Miso Ramen - They've revised their menu so this is no longer served in the downtown location. It was the only soup that had a strong flavor, but of soy sauce instead of miso. It's dark and thin which tells you that this is really lacking in miso.

Spicy Octopus Stir Fry Udon - It's reminiscent of the noodles that you might get at a Mongolian Barbeque restaurant. Lots of spice, but lacking in complexity.

Tempura Walleye Steam Bun - The small piece of fish had a thin soggy batter. The bun itself is the frozen Chinese type that cost a couple bucks for a package.

Overall, it is pricey even during happy hour and what you get is just passable. I'm still glad that there's more variety now in downtown rather than just another sandwich shop. There are several good ideas that need work and I hope that they hire a consultant to help with the recipes. The owner is friendly and the staff did a good job. I think this place could be a part of the food revolution happening here if it can adapt quickly to be more than just a niche place for hipsters.",4,0,0

Synopsis: We went out. We got hammered. We went to bed at 2:00am after some mild puking. 

First of all, there was zero parking near the trail entrance, so the walk to the trail was quite a warmup for us half-drunkards. We had heard that the hike could take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half, so expectations for the difficulty were quite low. Beginning the hike with an eager and aggressive pace (lasting a solid 4 minutes in), we quickly slowed down to a pace equivalent to that of an 80 year old man on his way to a colonoscopy. As the trail became steeper and the rocks became bigger, our two bottles of water for four people were immediately gone. I would like to note that the boulders on the climb were extremely dusty and obviously the maintenance crew had been doing a sub par job. I would also like to note that the signs guiding the hikers were few and far between, causing (hungover) classy ladies like ourselves to stray from the ""path."" They should probably think about installing water fountains along the side of the mountain, so fewer people would need to be air lifted from the trail due to dehydration. 

After reaching the top and expecting an overwhelming sense of achievement, we were quickly let down by the amount of children under 10 who had made the climb without even breaking a sweat. 

I would not recommend this trail to anyone. There is not an elevator to bring you down once you reach the top. You also do not get service to order an über helicopter (which we debated for a solid 10 minutes). 

Do not come here. Ever.",0,1,0

It came highly recommended by some friends in the industry.  I'd have to say overall, was disappointed with experience.  Place seemed pretty bustling for a Monday night, the only available seats were at the communal tables, which is fine, I don't mind sharing, but they have you packed in pretty tight, like I have to touch elbows with you every time I want a sip of water tight.  

I've been to many a traditional dim sum, I was intrigued by the American dim sum.  We let our server know we wanted to try the dim sum menu when we sat down and she said ""they'll be right out"" took our drink order and disappeared.  More than a half hour passes and no one comes with any food, nor does our server check back in on us at all.  Eventually a guy comes out with a tray (no carts as promised on the menu), we get 3\/5 items offered in microscopic portions, the other 2 items were essentially condiments (not sure I'd count kimchi as a ""dish"").  The Pork Belly Bites were delicious, sweet and savory, some caramelized bits and dressing in a sweet orange and chili mayo based sauce (reminded me of PF Changs, everyone's got a sriracha mayo something or other on the menu now).  Smoked Tofu and Soba Noodle Salad had 1 cube of tofu in it, soba touch overdone (or was last night's batch) and mushy, dressing was flavorful and zippy.  The Steak Tartare was a fine specimen, enjoyed the green curry flavors and nutty sweetness from peanuts (1 lacy crostini was a pretty skimpy though, what's with every restaurant ever not giving you enough toast, is it the most expensive thing on the plate??).

Overall, a little disappointed in at least the dim sum menu, perhaps will choose off the regular dinner menu next time, it reads interesting enough.  Asian food made with American ingredients or mix and match dishes was was Mom did for 50 years after immigrating to the U.S. Guess we'll see what happens next time.",0,1,0

Here's the thing, I felt that Hob Nobs was pretty good, but not quite impressive enough for the full 4 stars.

The building (apparently there's some history to it that I'm unaware if) itself is nicely set up.  I was there on a Sunday to study and try the place out.  I found seating right away, which is sometimes note worthy at places like these.  The setup of the building has it divided into rooms, which is clever.  It allows those in one room to be somewhat separated from the rest of the building.  When you're studying, this can be hugely advantageous.

Eventually, I decided that the coffee just wasn't enough.  It's decent coffee, better than other places I've been.  I ordered their turkey sandwich.  About 5 minutes later, one of the very pleasant staff brought it right to my table.  Minus the silverware, but I suppose you can't have it all.  I was pleased overall.  The turkey and Gouda were sliced to the perfect sandwich thickness.  Everything was fresh but, again, it was good, just not impressively so.

Later on, I realized there was live music playing in the main room.  Since we were so far in the back, it drifted in quietly, unobtrusive.  I really liked that.

I'll probably go back to Hob Nobs eventually.  It's certainly worth at least one visit (I've already recommended it to others as such), but since it's almost 30 minutes from me, I don't know if it's somewhere I'll find myself frequenting often.",3,0,1

The brisket philly cheese steak was good but I will have to go back to try out their pull pork and other sandwiches to give them a final rating.
I tried the country ham potato salad, which was good to and different!

The servers are very attentive and they are looking for you input on how the food tastes. 

When the lady next to me ordered her pulled pork sandwich, she got a large sandwich versus what I seen in the other places.

I will be back to try out other items on the menu.

I went back there with the crew. The flavors in the BBQ are ok.

But other than that I can't say the rest of my experience was as great as she was.  I went here for the first time because I needed some hair supplies and my hair dryer broke on me and I was in a rush to get a replacement.  I've heard of Sally's before so I decided I'd check it out.  I came to this particular location and found everything I was looking for including my hair dryer.  The day after, I went back to get an exchange for a hair razor because I purchased the wrong one.  No problem there, as it was a straight exchange.  A couple of days later, I tried to use my NEW hair dryer and it broke down after 2 uses... It was no longer blowing hot air.  WTF.. So I made a second trip to go exchange it for another one.  I exchanged a hair dryer that was cheaper than the original one I purchased and I was supposed to get a REFUND on the remaining balance, but instead the girl did a PURCHASE and charged me for the difference.  I didn't realize this until my bill came in the mail saying I did purchase rather than a return.  Annoyed, I went to the store a couple weeks later with my credit card bill asking to speak to the manager on duty about this.  Stephanie, the supervisor on duty, called her manager right away and took down my information, informing me that the manager would call me the following Monday when she was in.  Monday rolled around and I never received a call, I called on Tuesday and the girl told me that she never came in for her shift and that she'd pass along the message to call me back asap.  A week later, no call.  At this point, I'm irritated and angry with the horrible customer service, especially from the manager.  I went straight to Head Office and called them to inform them of the issue and what was going on.  The process of having to refund my money onto my credit card should not take over a month!  I spoke to a representative from Head Office and she said she would have to speak to the store and look further into the situation and she'd call me back.  A couple more days pass by, no call.  I decided I'd call Head Office AGAIN.  I spoke to a representative and she said that the manager was dealing with another customer and she would get her to call me back as soon as she was done instead of putting me on hold.  I was very stern and straight forward informing her that I would be really upset if she doesn't call back and she insisted she would let her manager know before she leaves for the day.  Never received a call within the next 15 minutes. I called back again, and got another representative  and told her that the manager on duty was supposed to call me back.  She went to go look for the manager and she had already left for the day!  At that point, I was livid and I expressed how I felt to the representative I was currently speaking to and she was EXTREMELY RUDE and interrupted me as I was speaking!  She even responded with ""Do you want a solution to this?..... Fant-astic!"" (In the most sarcastic voice ever).  She asked me to call my bank to ask them to reverse the charges and to let them know I didn't approve of it.  So basically after waiting a month to get this sorted out, she wanted me to solve it on my own.  How f'ed up is that?  The next day - of course, I receive a call from the store and from Head Office again.  Both of them left a voicemail stating that they would do the refund without any issues as long as I go into the store to do it..  SERIOUSLY?  I have to make another trip to the store to do a refund??  I called Stephanie to ask her if we could do the refund over the phone and she asked her manager and the manager said no because they needed my physical card to do the refund.   So now this was going to be my fourth trip to the store.. and that will be the last time I go back to the store, PERIOD.  In fact, I'm done with Sally's Beauty all together and I wish I had never purchased their $5 membership.",0,0,0

When my cat was sick in 2015 I brought him to bonanza cat hospital because of the amazing ratings. Never in a million years did I think they would be all about the money. My cat was in the hospital with them for about a week with a kidney and thyroid issue. I trusted them to care for my cat. Not once was I taken in the back to see my cat while they were caring for him. I kept getting calls that they were gonna try new meds and stuff bc he wasn't eating. The next day we went in to check on him and they never brought us to the back to see our cat. We had him for 15,years and he must of thought we abandoned him and didn't want to see him. All we wanted to do was see him and they made an excuse not to let us see OUR cat. Coincidentally the next day the cat passed. Never to see of him again. Did he die in his sleep? Did he die because he was in their care? Did they neglect him ? I will never know. Let's just say they sent me a bill of $1075 dollars and guess what.... I don't even have his ashes. Nothing at all. 15 years of my life just gone and I have nothing of his. No footprint, no speck of hair, no ashes  nothing. Nothing at all. Just gone for 2 years.  I have emailed them, called them, faxed them numerous times and have yet to get any response at all back from them what's so ever.   My husband is currently battling a brain tumor on disability with medical documentation and they have no decency to return calls or emails. Makes you kinda of wonder if he really died or whatever. I have zero proof of his passing. It sickens me that I put my trust into this hospital and have had nothing but stress with them. If you love your pets take them somewhere else. Trust me. They are all about the money.  So sad. I gave them every opportunity to get back to me before posting this. 2 years later is enough.  Thank you",1,0,0

My smoothie was ADDICTING! I want another because it is so refreshing and delicious! The soup was really good! It just needed salt. The rolls tasted good I just think the ingredients inside could of been fresher. I'm wondering if you can have them make them fresh? The white pizza was AWESOME! It had so much flavor and crunch to it. Not to mention that Phillip(?) was so helpful and friendly and gave me samples and conversed with me. Thanks for being cool, guy! With those four food items, I spent approximately $22-$25. Kind if pricey but it's worth it lol

Spring rolls were bad. The wrap was the ones Chinese restaurants use as opposed to what most Viet places do. It was two small rolls both cut into halves.  The fish sauce was absolutely tasteless. 

The pho was one price and one size. It was about a medium but costs the same as a large at other pho places. The beef they used was a third rate beef that were really tiny strips. Not the norm in pho. 

The curry was good but came with low grade rice vs the jasmine rice (extra cost).   Had a lot of chicken pieces which was good. 

Not to sound racist (because I'm not) but halfway through my meal I noticed that every customer in the place plus the take out orders where all non-asian. Maybe that says something about this place cuz other pho places I've been normally there are Asians.  However since the curry was good maybe this restaurant has better Thai food than Viet?

Pho - 2 star
Curry - 4 star

Almost a year into my Bikram practice, I'm hoping to make it a lifelong habit and I thus look for studios wherever I am living or traveling.  Enter Bikram Yoga Cleveland now that I am here.  

I attended my first class over the weekend and was very satisfied with my experience.  The studio is conveniently located at Fairmount and Warrensville, not too far from John Carroll.  The space itself is one of the nicer studios I have attended, with convenient cubbies in the lobby for belongings, coat racks, and clean, spacious bathrooms with several showers and individual lockers.  

The yoga studio is large and has plenty of mirrors for checking posture during the asanas.  I picked a spot near the back of the class (I'm still timid - plus I feel like the room is hotter if I'm right in front of the mirror) and spent some time in corpse pose before the class started.  However they heat the studio, it is very comfortable and not the dry, direct heat that some studios employ that just makes me miserable the whole 90 minutes.  

My instructor was super friendly.  There were several people who were new to the Bikram practice that day, and she took the time to help them with adjustments, and didn't have a problem with them taking a break in savasana or sipping water as they needed to between the poses.  I've had many Bikram teachers who take the practice too seriously, but she was not one of them.  

The only thing I didn't like about this studio was the floor.  I had trouble maintaining my separate leg postures (stretching, triangle) because it's so slippery.  I know I am not the only one who had this problem because a few people fell while getting into the posture in the class I took.  So, caution if you go!

By the end I had gotten my weekly dose of bliss, and was ready to re-hydrate and head back for another class within the week.  No matter what you're looking for - stretching, strengthening, or inner peace - find it at Bikram Yoga Cleveland!",5,1,3

The positives:
- Friendly, Attentive Staff
- Lots of space\/clean changing rooms
- 2 great dance studios (3rd space not so great)
-Good location (although a bit hard to locate due to some construction)
-Great music selection for the dance class, it was diverse and upbeat and easy to groove to
- I showed up late and everyone was nice to me and didn't make me feel rushed or embarrassed
-Offer tons of classes in many different styles

Negatives:
-HOT!!!! I was sweating without even moving!!! Much, much too hot
-the 3rd, small dance space was so small that the dance move that required a ""back kick"" resulted in me and another girl getting kicked in the face! Not impressed- the dance instructor should have tweeked the lesson to ditch the kick with so many people in such a small space.
-I assumed it being a drop-in, beginner class, that it would be basic, broken-down steps that anyone could arrive at and join in--- wrong! The instructor kept mentioning 'new people' and 'last week' and 'regulars'. I continued to think: ""isn't this a drop-in class, not a registered one?"" why was it building off of things from previous weeks? and the pace at which the instructor taught seemed to be for people with some experience, not beginners. The steps were walked through once, put to a beat and then implemented as a group. I didn't understand the terms he was using at all and even when he broke down the steps, he used terms I didn't know and explained rather poorly. He was definitely a skilled dancer, but maybe not as adept at translating that to others.
I found myself very sweaty and very frustrated at the end and just wanted the class to be over.
I will look for break dance classes elsewhere, ones that are truly beginner level. However, I won't write-off City Dance Corps all together- it was a nice facility and they offer a range of drop-in courses that I might try in the future.",4,0,1

Well, kinda wish we hadn't.  First, let me say the server and manager were very good.  They did their best to take care of us.  That's good...but...

The Guaca-Tony bread was very salty.  No idea why, but it was.  And I LIKE salt.  I'm a potato chip junkie.  But it just didn't work here.  The guacamole was mediocre, too.  Definitely ""meh"".  If it hadn't been free we might have sent it back.

The calamari was overcooked, too heavily breaded, and salty.  We actually sent that one back.  If you read my reviews you would know I almost never do that.  Maybe once a year.   

Lastly we got the rigatoni.  It was spicy and pretty good.  We added meatballs.  They were OK.  Not fabulous, but OK.  Reasonably large, too (though not large like Buca).  The garlic bread that came with it was salty. What's with all the salt? I love salt, but this was too much.  I've never experienced this before.  And it wasn't just me.  My wife had the same reaction.

I'm surprised to see four stars on Oregano's.  Maybe if we had ordered the pizza instead?  But what we ordered was mostly disappointing.

In comparison to other places, this is pretty steep for warmed up food, lousy atmosphere. The music was so loud the girl behind cash couldn't hear my husband ordering. It was listening to Charlie Brown's peoples on the phone (whomp, whomp, whomp) a couple times he had to repeat himself. He couldn't even hear me tell HIM I wanted him to get a curry chicken dinner for my son and a stew dinner for me...lol. Honestly, the server behind cash looked pretty clueless anyway and her child was crawling all over her and between her and the cash register so she could barely see while punching in our order. Then she tried to let us walk away WITHOUT our hot sauce. $50 dollar order and walk away with no hot sauce meanwhile it's on the counter right by our order to be packed? And why are the cooks coming out from the kitchen to pack orders? The girl at cash should packing orders, maybe along with someone else if busy. This is why we almost left our hot sauce. The girl from the kitchen thought we wanted hot sauce in a cup from the squeeze bottle. So between the girl at cash, who heard us ask for our bottle and knew it was there and was going to let the kitchen staff get us squeeze bottle hot sauce, then the girl behind cash comes and says oh hear. Oh boy *rolls eyes*. 

Anyway, on to the food. Too much anise flavour in the goat curry (roti). Dahl roti was the best thing, it was huge but not so much filling. Why such a huge roti for four pieces of boneless chicken and one potato? The flavour of curry was okay. On to the worst, the stew chicken was sweet. Yuck. No balance, pure sugar or ketchup or something. It was no good and we were charged, get this, an extra 50 cents for rice and peas instead of white rice. Really? Why?? Lol. Like seriously? Your food is pricey already. You really need that 50 cents? Most places give rice and peas standard with the food unless you ask for white rice instead, no up charge. Just weird.

I got a quotation from Edmunds.com and the sale person called me (Jim, John or whatever). The main reason why I visited that store is he said they have a lot more physical stocks than the system shows. When we went there, there is only one Accent (I specifically needed an Accent) left. He lied to me. He said they have 6 or something. We did walk around the parking lot for a while to find non-existed other cars. He called somewhere then he told me that they sold 5 cars of Accents yesterday. What??? I really really wish I should run away at that moment.

Anyway, I purchased an Accent at that day and they asked me to pay in cash. I tried to pay part of my payment (to get points) with my visa card but they said Arizona law requires to pay  in cash to purchase a vehicle. Is it true? By the way, I have 785 FICO score. What I do not understand is how all the people are so cooperating to cheat their customer. They were so pushing to sell extra warranty and financing by asking me more than 5 times.

Then, the price suddenly went up tremendously with all the hidden cost. Anyway, I purchased it because I needed that car urgently for my friend, temporary guest. 

Because the tinting was not enough (one of my daughters has sun allergy), the sales person promised that he will do something for us. Then, I could not find him for 3 days after purchasing my car and he did not do anything. It seems like he thought that I will return the car so he was continously hiding? Eventually, he asked me $300 for another tinting a week later. WOW!!!! He must think that I am a bank or something. What he did was just avoiding me. I talked with their customer service manager and they do not care once they sell the car. They are very good at avoiding issues and running away. It is surprising that the customer service manager cannot do anything but covering their sale man's fault. 

I talked with my lawyer to put them in trouble but my lawyer said it is not worth it because this place is already notorious for ripping off customers. it is clear that they just want to milk money as much as they can from the first customer then say bye~. Customers will never come back. But, Chapman Hyundai does not care because most Americans do not purchase a vehicle frequently. They just need to attract new customers who have no idea about them through fake reviews. 

I called Hyundai USA and Atlanta factory to make sure everybody knows the name of this dealer. Since I posted this story on Koreans and Chines community web sites, none of them will go to this place. I made sure this dealership's customer satisfaction rate will reflect true numbers (they offered $20 free gas for 10 satisfaction rate but I put 0 zero).i.  

I believe Chapman's sales policy is clear. They do NOT care once sell it. But, they really should understand good customer will come back continuously with their family and friends if you are doing business right. By the way, I purchase a car every two years. 

If you go there, you need to pay attention when they add several additional hidden cost after agreeing with the vehicle price. They will use tons of tricks to increase your vehicle price later. 

Also, they put my wrong name on the contract paper so I asked my sales person (John or whatever) to change it. He said that he will do it. But, my wrong name was on the paper. I asked them several times. However, I still get Hyundai promotional material under my wrong name. 

Last but least, the internet sales manager said he will give me $100 from his own pocket if I refer my friend. Is this true? From his pocket? 

I am just wondering whether the owner of this dealership actually does care about his business with these non-integrity oriented people.

A series of soft-serve machines crank out a variety of frozen yogurts at the back; a topping bar takes up one side wall, and photos of 'celebrities' take up the other. The centre of the room is taken up by a weigh station and cash register. 

The yogurt itself is pleasant enough, although it melts a bit quickly if you're a slow eater. You pick up a giant cardboard tub and have at it. Tasting cups make an amateur food critic's job easier; I sample half of what's offered, before settling on chocolate\/vanilla swirl. My date loves the cake batter, and it tastes as promised, although I prefer a fabulously fruity pina colada and strawberry mix. The original flavour is tart and refreshing, but I have a weakness for the classics. 

And really, if you're coming here for the yogurt itself, you're missing the point. 

The real draw for adults and kids alike is the insane range of toppings available for yo' fro-yo. Everything from cookies in raw and cooked crumbles, to candies, to syrups and fruit (yeah, right) beckons. 

This is where my critical faculties fail me. Menchies' design, like a buffet or large chain, is built to resist proper food criticism; it shifts the onus entirely to the consumer, and promises an experience in abandon. Do peanut butter candies really belong with chocolate and strawberry syrups and skor bits and cookie dough, etc. etc. etc? If you were to see a composed dish like this on a menu, you'd likely say ""Hell no"". 

Menchies throws precisely this culinary gauntlet. You choose it, you eat it. Menchies appeals to our worst nature, then charges us by the ounce for the thrill of blind choice.  As adults, we are used to the restraint preached by Coco Chanel, that before one leaves the house one should remove at least one accessory. At Menchies we return to the childhood glee of more, more, more.

I came here with my family. We were seated in one of the large tables and right next to us was another family. It was practically just two parties in this restaurant, cramped next to each other. I was unsure why they didn't seat us separately so we would have more room. 

We ordered honey walnut shrimp, Mongolian beef, house fried rice, wonton soup, noodle soup, roasted pig, and flounder fish. (very typical dishes)

Fried rice and flounder fish was okay. The honey walnut shrimp and Mongolian beef was nothing I've ever tasted before. It tasted very different. I expected it to be the same taste with what you would usually get from a Chinese restaurant. But these dishes were so off.

What went in my belly:

Sashimi Omakase - 17 pieces of premium assortments of sashimi ($25). ) The platter came with salmon, hamachi, fluke, white tuna, red tuna, scallop, uni, squid and shrimp. Incredibly fresh and really great value!

Uni Handrolls ($3 each) and Spicy Salmon Handroll ($2.30 each). Like the sashimi, the fish was incredibly fresh. What I loved about these rolls was the fact that there was filling up until the very last bite. There's nothing worse than taking one bite out of your handroll only to realize the rest of it is just rice. You know what I'm talking about!

Maguro No Tataki - lightly seared tuna served with garnish and ponzu ($6.50). Good but nothing special in my opinion. The least memorable dish of the evening.

Hokke ($13.50). Served grilled, this fish is similar to hamachi. The portion is quite substantial and while I found it a touch salty, it was still pretty darn tasty.

Spider Roll ($16). It came highly recommended by our server and I can see why. It was one of the best spider rolls I've had. Every bite had a nice crunch from the soft shell crab and was packed full of flavour. Yes, it's a little pricey but like the hokke, it's quite large.

I am a big fan of Shoeless Joes and go to their other various locations however this location always seems to disappoint me no matter how many times I give them a chance. I came here last Friday with a friend..it was beginning to get busy and they had a few reserved signs around a few tables. I got to the hostess stand and asked if their were any booths available. The hostess immediately said no without checking and then brought us to a half booth which was fine. We sat down and our server who was very kind came to get our drink orders after 5 minutes of waiting (fair its busy) however we already knew what we were getting and put in our order. I also asked the waitress if we were able to change the TV channel to Sportsnet One as I wanted to watch the Canada Women's Soccer Game that was playing on various other TVs around the establishment. She said she would check with her manager, 10 minutes later her manager came by and began to change the TV BEHIND ME! I told her if she could change the one infront of me because I obviously can't watch TV through the back of my head. She then got annoyed and said she could only change one TV..which was fine because only I wanted to watch not my friend. She began switching the channels (they only have about 6 to work with!?) and then left it on..however, unfortunately as she put it on TIm and Sid decided to broadcast instead. 

My friend got her french onion soup and enjoyed it but complained a little about how it wasn't as cheesy as she usually has hers. After 10 minutes our food came, I got the classic burger and added bacon and my friend got the burger with mushrooms. I was VERY disappointed with the whole 25 french fries I got..which makes me think that they pre-set plates with french fries for the evening rush. My burger was good, really tender but the meat to bun ratio was off as the burger kept sliding out and making it a very messy experience. 

We looked through their dessert options to end but decided not to go for anything, when we got our bills..I got charged for my friends burger instead and she got charged for mine, we had to get our bills re-done correctly. We ended up paying and leaving..really disappointed. 

Although their food can be really good they seem to crush under pressure during the evening rush and therefore lack in food quality and consistency. I was hoping they would be a little bit more generous and their staff\/manager a little bit kinder but you can't get it all with franchises..

Uncle Tetsu Food: I've had the original cheesecake, Angel hat, and honey madeleine. I find the cheesecake and angel hat to be very similar in taste, it seems like the only differences are the shape and the angel hat is ever so slightly fluffier (I guess from being crust less?). I would choose having the cheesecake instead because it's easier to slice and share. Both cakes are airy and just melt in your mouth from how silky the texture is. They hardly weigh anything so you'll hardly feel it at the tip of your fork. The flavour that sticks out most is a ricotta cheese (?) taste. It's very light so try not to drink anything cold\/hot or eat something too flavorful before eating the cake or you'll find it flavour less. The madeleines are very different but still tasty - they are sweet and have a thicker cake texture. I wouldn't come here just for Madeleines though. 

Matcha Cafe Food: I was very eager to try the matcha soft serve since I really enjoy matcha in general. But to my disappointment, I felt the soft serve was more of a sorbet. The cone began melting before it was even handed to me. It tasted like it was made from frozen water rather than milk\/cream. And the flavour was really lacking, I could hardly find the matcha flavour even after tasting it carefully. The soft serve definitely didn't go well with the flavour of the cone too. I think the cone had a more distinct flavour than the soft serve. My friend and I agreed that it wasn't worth the wait and we most likely won't be back to try it again. 

Service: While you line up you get the opportunity to see the staff prepare and cook all the food through the windows. The staff are friendly and quiet. Expect to wait a while for anything you order though. There is always a line no matter what the weather is like. 

Why only 3 stars? I like the cakes and the price is definitely on point but I don't find them that special to go out of my way to order. I'll usually only stop here if it's en route to somewhere else I have to be. And the line ups can be ridiculously long. On an average day I won't stop if I see the line is longer than 10-15min. The food isn't that amazing for me to wait more than 20min tops. 

Refrigerated or not? I prefer it NOT refrigerated. I find that after it gets cold, it no longer remains silky smooth. The cold makes the cake more solid and somehow loses some of its flavour as well. I'd rather leave it out for one night if I know it will be finished the next day.",1,0,0

Indeed, the server who handled V's and my drinks all night (a $10 per person netted donatee drink coupons for a mojito- d'lish!- and a beer\/wine, and a sweet goody bag*) wore a SpaFitFinder shirt, but did not offer up any info on its services, neither.

I can say the martinis I had were good.  Loved the mojito and the Inhibition -something (vodka, peach schnapps, and cranberry juice, minus the cranberry juice, and instead, club soda and sour).  Didn't care for the house pinot grigio.  I will say that the jalapeno and olive tapenade bruschetta and the grilled marinated skirt steak skewer were tasty... (FYI, the noise level was a lot lower at the resto, but the band, while they played pleasing music, did get loud at the end.  Also, the service was quicker.  Appreciated the fact that our server was honest in telling me that he hadn't tried the dessert I'd asked him about.  Other less-conscientious servers would've gushed about how it was their fave item off the menu to make the sale.  Kudos to Anthony!)

Before I even sat down, he acted as though he was inconvenienced to have to do my nails.  He didn't look up from his phone or turn off his music and then said, ""What you want.""  I showed him a picture and started explaining the shape, and he cut me off, stating, ""I know.""  I resisted the urge to ask for someone else that early on.  

He proceeded to have the personality of a potato and rushed like he needed to get back to his phone.  He cut them without asking how long and then asked after he'd cut them how they were.  I answered that they were shorter than I thought they'd be, and he snapped, ""I asked you how long and you didn't say anything.""  I obviously never heard this, and the logical thing to do is ask again if someone doesn't answer.  My response was that I had shown him the photos, to which he claimed he had done but then said my nail beds were not long like those.  I showed him two nails were glued on crooked, and he shook his head over and over, sighing.  He told me he didn't see anything. I  couldn't take it anymore; I told him he must not like his job and had zero customer service skills.

He started complaining to another lady about me, and I told her exactly what I told him.  She tried to get me to leave them without color, but they already looked badly short and wide, and I asked for color from the start.

The trip tip was a bit fatty, it did have a thin smoke ring, and maybe a 6oz portion.  it was cooked through, no pink.  Maybe it had sat for a while in the warmer, maybe not, but I was surprised at the fatty bits.  Usually, slow cooked tri tip has none or very little.  The three or four pork ribs were appropriately moist, but all the meats were bland enough to need the BBQ sauce.  

The BBQ tomato sauce was ordered spicy, but needed more heat.  Thick, not watery at all.  

Mac-n-cheese, looked like they're using a cheese that dries up after warming, tasted like they use Oxaca style, so not much cheddar or velveeta detected.  Noodles were done well, most were whole.  

Cornbread was moist and buttery, needed no sauce or additional garnishment.

This review is about BE Corporate, as I believe the problem I am reporting is their doing, not the local restaurant's. 

So here's my complaint: BE has 3 new ""hash"" items on their menu. I chose the vegetable version. In the menu, the photo of each version is decked out in a wrought iron skillet with 2 eggs on top. Given the $9 price I expected the portion would at least approach dinner-size.

Wrong. The portion was the size of a small side salad. It came in a saucer-size bowl about 1"" thick, with a bottom diameter that was about 80% of the diameter @ the bowl's top edge. (My thinking here is that BE Corporate offices purchased these bowls as optical illusions. Kind of a dumb decision, as it's insulting to customers.)

I estimate the total serving size to be 1.3 cups or maybe 1.5. In the mix of 4 or 5 types of stir fried veggies--probably 1\/16th a cup of each type--are the still-tasty-and-reliable (if salty) BE home fries. But the serving size was about 12 individual potato cubes. 1\/4, or at best 1\/3, of a regular portion if I had chosen a breakfast menu item. 

The taste of the ""hash"" was fine (it wasn't really hash...it was diced veggies). But the TINY portion ruined the meal for me. 

I suspect these portions are strictly defined by the BE Corporate offices, as this is not the first time I've seen these SKIMPY portions @ BE.  But I think it will be the last. Things like this, and some degradation in the tastiness of the non-breakfast items in recent years, are pushing me away from BE. 

Maybe the new owners will get BE back to its former glory days.

Ambiance: 4\/5
- The exterior of the hotel is quite large making it easier to find. The outside is kinda weird looking to be fair, and doesnt do the inside justice. There's also a large  sign that says ""now open"" on the outside, which Im not sure is necessary, and feels tacky.
- The individual floors look GREAT. The carpet is a really cool retro black and red which I LOVE but may appear outdated in the next few years
- The rooms are large, but the furniture is strangely oriented. There is a chair that you can on (sorta like a pool bench, I forget what those are called, if you dont wanna sit in bed. The couch thing faces towards the TV while the bed does not: which is really weird.
- Plenty of parking. Free and easily accessible.

Service: 5\/5
- I have no qualms with service. It was great when I didnt it, but I didnt need it much.
- FREE AND FUNCTIONING WIFI. FREE BREAKFAST, of course both standard with any Hampton. 
-There's a small convenience shop at the front desk with Sodas, and some snacks, which is great if you are up late\/ jet lagged. Its not extensive, but enough

Rooms: 4\/5 (I was in a standard economy room) 
-Plasma screen TV's, laptop desk to use on your bed, plenty of outlets, etc. perfect for the business person.
-Plenty of lighting in the room. Good space, and pretty good decor. 
- Large king size bed.
- Standard amenities. Nothing here blew my mind, but nothing was subpar either. 

Food:
- No room service: this was unfortunate. The only thing that delivers here is Pizza.
- Easy to access 24\/7 small convenience store down store with soda, lean cuisine, ramen and snacks\/toiletries.

The crust was blackened. When I asked about it, the server told me it was supposed to be like that. 

The soda bottles were fun and nostalgic, but I prefer fountain drinks. It seemed like a cheap way to keep drink costs down and keep the servers less busy filling drinks. 

The food seemed a little overpriced to me. The server didn't seem very attentive, and didn't notice that I didn't eat. That's okay. Plenty of other customers were just waiting for my seat. I just don't get it.

Garlic Sparerib: I like that it was crispy and the it had a really strong garlic flavor. The spareribs were kind of tough to eat but the flavor was good.
Spicy Lamb: This was really spicy. I thought a bit too spicy for me but if you love really spicy food, this is good. The lamb was really good too like it wasn't too dry.
Bean Sprouts with various vegetables: Stir fried pretty well. It wasn't overly done but can still taste the oil and heat from the wok. Got to have some vegetables with all that meat.

Service was good. There was enough waiters and waitresses to help with all the tables.

The restaurant is in a plaza so the amount of space they have isn't large. They can put some tables together if there's a larger party.

This place definitely has a nice vibe to it.  Both times we ended up buying an assortment of candies from the candy store.  The little restaurant\/market place downstairs was closed the first time, but open on the Sunday.  My mom loved the little bridal store in there, since she is in the bridal business herself.  I must say that the bulldog store is just a little too weird for me, but I'm sure they have their own customers who love them.

The waiter then told me that if we sat at the bar, we would be served sooner, which is complete bullshit, I go to dinner with my husband to enjoy dinner and talk with my husband and not sit at the bar watching them make my sushi, i like my privacy once in a while considering I have 2 little kids at home!!!

Once at the top you'll be amazed at the club like scene waiting for you just around the corner.  Its every cheating husbands dream as this spot is surely romantic.   

Now go take your date outside, enjoy the view of Las Vegas.  You'll see over the horizon as the city lights up your soul to achieve big things.

Booked dinner. Nice place.  Service decent. The problem is the food.  I ordered the $74 dollar Waygu steak.  I was expecting to be blown away. I was.. with how HORRIBLE it was.  

First, when enjoying a steak at this price, I was expecting to taste the meat.  It was covered in sauteed onions like a cheap $6 dollar Salisbury steak.  It was cooked medium well when I asked for medium rare.  You can get a better steak at a coffee shop.  I didn't send the steak back because my wife set the reservation up and I didn't want her to think I wasn't appreciating the experience. So I had to sit back and choke down this horrible piece of meat knowing that I was going to be paying over $300 for the dinner, which made it all that much worse.  The desert is no better than a $20 Vegas strip buffet. 

 I wish I took a photo of the meal to share. Anyhow, the view is great and so is the atmosphere and that is what you are paying for. So bottom line.

there were 10 of us. that is 6 too many! haha! it was sensory overload!! haha! 

first you start off in the lounge area where you can have drinks while they prepare your dining space. this is where you go over the menu and decide what you are having. then your server who is visually impaired tells you how things are going to go.. so we all line up single file behind each other.. each of us placing our hand on the shoulder of the person in front of us. we are lead into foyer before the dining area.. so it starts to get dark.. then we enter the dining area and you can't see a thing!!! 

once we are all seated, our server took our drink order and asked for our names one by one. i told our server i recognized him from ryerson university and seeing him on the streetcar with his daughter in the mornings. he seemed pleased by this. 

upon his return he had already started to remember some of our names. he then asks what app, entree and dessert we are having as each course is about to happen. 

so you are sitting there in complete darkness.. you can't see your hand.. one friend sounded like they were at the other end of the table and they were right beside me.. then the person in front of me sounded so far away! when it comes to eating i just used my hands.. why bother with cutlery!! 

i had a salad which tasted fresh.. mushrooms.. lettuce.. nuts.. tasty. then my entree was a beef dish with roasted veggies.. well this is where my taste buds and my brain clashed!! the beef tasted like poo to me :0( i would eat a veggie and go back to the beef but it still tasted bad. luckily dessert was delicious!

so if you go.. keep your dinner party small.. no more than 4 people.. and be prepared for an awesome and possibly overwhelming experience! :0)",1,1,0

This store isn't for folks like me - I get it. Unfortunately, my friends and family aren't all committed to my outdoors-free existence and from time to time I find myself in places like this. 

I came here for ski stuff specifically. While I know REI doesn't specialize in ski gear, they do have certain stores designated as ""ski stores"" . The one by my house isn't a ski store, but this one way the hell far away from me is. Ok, I make the drive and imagine my surprise to find 4 freaking pairs of ski boots! A sad selection of ski socks, a terrible selection of skiis! WTF REI. I used to shop at the REI in Houston (also a ""ski store"") and it had 10x the selection. Why would Houston have better stuff than Vegas - a store located within driving distance to mountains!??! UGH

A side note is stores like this really bother me in general. The things they sell are so ridiculous only fools that go camping would ever think to buy them. Stainless steel and plastic wine glasses?!?! If you aren't drinking out of a proper glass, just please get a solo cup or something or drink out of the freaking bottle. If you're bothering to bring wine camping and know anything about wine you'd know enough to know that if you aren't drinking out of real glass, there's no point in buying a ""wine glass"" that's plastic or stainless steel. Why must people pretend their are homeless for an evening to get their kicks? 

Lastly, I hate the stupid REI program they harass you about THE ENTIRE TIME you're in this awful store. I don't want to buy your program - stop bothering me about it. I've heard the speech too many times now, I try to make you stop and you still give it. Checking out is a nightmare here - I feel like i'm at a time share presentation. 

Overall, I realise I'm not this store's target audience, but when forced to buy outdoorsy crap, this is one of my least favorite places. Terrible annoying sales people and a slim selection, even compared to other REI stores.",5,8,3

First time here and the restaurant looked very trendy and hipster. There was a complimentary appetizer of bread with olive oil, which is a classic Italian appetizer. However, I found the crust of the bread to be a bit too hard. The appetizers we ordered were the kale salad with fennel, radish, red onion and ricotta salata. I found the kale to be very oily, but I liked the cheese that was sprinkled on top of the salad and the radish and fennel went well with the kale. As for our main courses, I had trofie pasta with kale, pesto and pecorino. The pasta was in bite sizes rather than a long string of pasta. Never had this kind of pasta in my life. My friend ordered osso buco with red wine risotto. I thought it was delicious. For dessert, I ordered caramelo chocolate mud pie and my friend ordered apple crumble with creme Anglais. I thought they were wonderful desserts, tasted as good as I expected. I would give that five stars and the main courses and appetizers four stars.

As for service however, I felt there was a lack of, but I wouldn't say they were unfriendly. Rather aloof and unattentive. Didn't even introduce themselves when first taking our order and didn't really check on us. Never poured water for us, we did it for ourselves. There was more than one waiter serving us, so I didn't even know who I was tipping exactly.

I probably would have never seen this place because it is in the back corner of the casino.  If it were instead some kind of Thai Las Vegas buffet, then it would definitely be worth the trip inside Bally's.

Now came the food, the food was alright. Nothing spectacular in comparison to the other ramens I've had over at Miso-ya and Sora. The broth is a lot lighter, which a lot of people might like and appreciate more than me who is a fan of heavier-flavored broths and giant pieces of tender char-siu :,,:
Don't get me wrong though, the pork was delicious and tender, but the pieces were much more generous over at Sora. 

In this highly competitive, emerging market of Ramen and Japanese food in Vegas, Jinya stood out with its appeal rather than amazing food. I enjoy eye-candy myself though.",0,0,0

Where do I start off? I started with soup, as soon as I saw it from a far being swirled around by the chef standing by, I felt a little skeptical about getting it. You could automatically tell that shit was all starch, because it was soooooo thick. It was soooo bland, blegh. Crab legs? That stuff tasted so old, it was frozen cold too. And there's barely any meat. My boyfriend took advantage of their meat selection. He mentioned the meat was tough and bland. We are a big fan of truffle recipes. And they had macaroni and cheese made with some truffle oil. It was gross, it was all butter and a tiny dash of truffle oil to make it smell like it. 

The only thing good about this place, in terms of food, was their unlimited crepes. I was able to get a dinner crepe and a dessert crepe after. Both were OKAY. 

The staff that were working and taking our plates were very sweet. They refilled our drinks as soon as they were empty and they took our plates fast. I was able to converse with one of the chefs making my crepe, she was cool too. 

But, I thought this place wasn't good. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Even one of our taxi drivers said that this place is one of the worst buffets here because we told him how we ate there.",4,2,2

Stuck in a rut involving trips to different salons hoping to find a cure for my bad hair day. One of those trips was to this salon and I was actually quite happy when I left (which is a rarity). 

The salon was nice and modern, like all hairdressing salons are these days. The staff were as nice as can be and I was suitably entertained with magazines and juice. The hairdresser listened and seemed to do what I asked, with the obligatory ""any holidays booked\/what are you doing at the weekend"" questions. 

But what impressed me was that this hairdresser (sorry, her name escapes me) managed to attack my frizz ball with a hairdryer and live to tell the tale. Hairdryers are my arch nemesis. When I go to the hairdresser I am embarrassed when they blow dry my hair as it triples in volume before they save it with GHD's. This is why I don't own a hairdryer, we don't get along. Well not this time! This girl blow dried my hair so perfectly smooth and straight that I didn't even need GHD's.

efD-rkI91XrfzFiO4iafZA,HvhoErCwtEdNiNVUjsIT9A,8ybZDBHM4-r_O2F7J8zz-w,2,2012-06-12,"I was a member of LA Fitness for about six months. In short, I don't have anything against them but I do not feel they are the best place to train, nor have I been impressed with their business practices.

When I showed up, like many I did so expecting to receive a two-week pass to try them out. I was sat down by a young woman who explained to me that ""You look pretty fit, you don't really need to try it out, do you?"" I said ""Yes, I really do."" In a typical hard-sale case, she brought over the gym manager, ""Rock."" Rock wrote down several numbers and what-if's on a piece of paper. I thanked him,  but insisted on a trial period before I signed anything. They were very frustrated, and just about demanded I sign up then and there or leave. It was even a battle to get that piece of paper out of his hands, so I could take it home and sleep on it. 

Since my wife and I live so close, we ended up signing a month-to-month contract. The price was $60 for both of us, plus a little extra if we wanted towels. I found out later that a racquetball court premium had been added to the contract, something I had not asked for but did end up using.

The gym itself is adequate for some purposes. There are plenty of cardio machines, two free standing squat racks, one power rack, and the usual assortment of machines. I personally train like a powerlifter, a la Mark Rippetoe, Grey Skull, or Jim Wendler. If you don't know, that basically means I hover around the squat racks and do most of my work there, squatting deep and pressing heavy. The best part of LA FItness? I never had to wait for a squat rack! I could usually even get the power rack during rush hour, which is quite convenient.

For weightlifters, steer clear. They only have the octagonal plates which roll into your shins when you're deadlifting, and there is not enough room near the racks to clean or snatch in any conceivable fashion without impaling someone with an olympic bar. To some this is the standard in a commercial gym, but as the months went on it got very frustrating. To their benefit, I never had any trainers give me trouble, they were too busy having bored housewives do bosu ball dumbell presses and other nonsense. 

Which leads me to my only real beef with LA Fitness: the way lone women are hunted like gazelles in the African summer. Numerous times my wife was squatting, only to have some emaciated munchkin come up to her and ask why she was going below parallel. Normally a paradigm of polite behavior, she actually had to curse at patrons a few times to get them to leave her alone. I had to start escorting her to the power rack just so she would be left alone. Ridiculous! Where was the staff? The trainers knew what was going on, but being too busy wasting peoples' money they never interceded, even when she clearly was being harassed right next to an employee. 

Most patrons of LA Fitness treat it like a social club. Headbands and yoga pants are the norm, and many are there more to chat up their friends than train. If that's your thing, hey, go for it, but my gym membership is so I can train, not high-five next to the decline while you have your three buddies spot your half-reps of 135.

We have since moved up the road to Gold's. The staff is friendlier, people there actually train, and my wife can work out without being harassed by bro's. The only real reason to hold an LA membership is for the swimming pool and racquetball courts, if that's your thing.",6,4,1

I went here as a recommendation from a friend as we are visiting from out of town.  Have you ever gone somewhere and from a recommendation thought this place is going to be great only to be let down?  Yep!  This is the place!  I was given the technician Ricky.  I purchased a $40 pedicure and was also doing the gel manicure with a design.  While Ricky was doing the pedicure he did do a short honey scrub massage BUT did not do the oil massage as described by their brochure.  He then went on to do my nails and this too was a nightmare.  My friend that has been going here for a while has always paid $5 for a design but Ricky was trying to tell me that it was $20 while my friends technician was also quoting $5.  Finally after he argued for a while with me he said okay to $5.  When he was finished (the whole time it took almost 3 hours) I joined my friend and told her about not getting a massage.  She told the owners wife Amanda and she started to get very rude.  She informed us that she will look at the cameras as if we were lying to her about not getting a massage.  A while later we checked out with a 10% discount a huge amount of frustration.  
The next day my friend and I called the owner Dustin.  This turned into another mess.  On the drive home from the salon the day before we both noticed that the pink hue in our nails had actually turned purple.  So we had shadow purple stains under our pink polish.  Dustin was very short with us on the phone but said to come in to get it fixed at 1:30.  When we went in my friends technician and my technician started talking about us in front of us.  Yes, you heard that right.  They said ""oh, they are back from yesterday"" and were laughing.  It was terrible.  Oh, it gets much worse.  Dustin went back while I was there to check the cameras and wanted to argue with me about getting the massage.  He wanted to prove to me that I did get it.  He shows me that I got the honey scrub massage...I said yes I said I got that.  However, he could not prove that I did get the oil massage with lotion that everyone enjoys and that I paid for.  Then Dustin's wife Amanda proceeded to argue with me about how long we were there.  I said we were there 3 hours and she was arguing with me while doing another customers nails saying that no we were not.  The receptionist brought over the receipt and it said we were there 2 hours and 45 minutes.  Very very close to 3 hours off by 15 minutes.  So, needless to say they did not fix any of my nails and I was left a very unsatisfied customer.  There are so many different nail salons in Las Vegas (former resident) and so many different options.  I would suggest checking out another place that actually values their customers and doesn't want to scare them away.",1,0,1

I had one of the signature appetizers, the scallops ""Benedict,"" but I felt the scallops were the weakest part of the dish (a bit dry, a bit overcooked)--the fried quail egg, chorizo slice, and potato cake were well done.  The lobster foam didn't do much for me, but the dish overall was good.

There are two things that brought my rating of this place down--the service and the atmosphere.  Our main waiter was friendly enough, but he was a bit aloof and took too much of a hands-off approach with us.  What seemed like huge pockets of time passed in between courses--he disappeared often and we were often kept waiting.  In general, the larger parties (6+) seemed to be getting much more attention than the several parties of 2 that were dining that night.  Our other servers seemed to do a better job with us.

As for the atmosphere, I'd read that David Burke was tired of fine dining and wanted to move away from it.  That's fine and good, considering the ""egg-themed"" decor and the whimsical use of color and shape in the art pieces, not to mention the restaurant's location right across from the V Bar with the heavy bass thumping and cranked up to the max.  But I think  the latter completely detracted from the dining experience.  The server who brought each course to us would explain the ingredients and the preparation of each course, but we were never able to hear him over the loud music and thumping.

For $100\/person, I would expect a less confused, much more consistent dining experience.  The food is absolutely great, but on a Friday night in Vegas, even with the economy being the way it is, this place should have been packed.  (We walked by other restaurants afterwards, such as Delmonico Steakhouse, just two doors down, and Michael Mina in the Bellagio--packed, packed, packed houses of people willing to spend a good amount of money on food.)  Trying to make this place young and hip is one thing, but all aspects have to be on par and up to the same high standards as the food if it's going to stick around and if I'm going to consider ever coming back to eat here.",0,0,0

When you get orders to report to a new duty station, you have to go or be considered AWOL. That is why I explicitly asked the young lady who worked for Mr. Apollo and Fasi Sports if they honored the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act which she said they did.
Mr. Apollo says he was in the Navy so he knows that if I chose not to suddenly pay, he could ruin my credit and cause me to lose my security clearance which would directly impact my career in the Army.
After 15 years of service and multiple tours in the middle east, this is the ONLY business that chose not to honor the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act. I was never late with a payment. I did not seek charity. What I sought was Fasi Sports honoring their word. Myself and another Soldier were SCAMMED. Period. We were both forced to pay the $600 early termination fee even with orders to report to a new duty station. Unfortunately, neither of us did not have the time nor the financial resources to fight this in court.
I can't believe I'm still getting messages from other Yelpers about this place two years later. Mr. Apollo claims to be a former service member which makes what he did to us that much more unbelievable. The values of honor and integrity, which are cornerstones of the military, definitely did not resonate with Mr. Apollo. I'm not a ""hater"" or any other childish term. I'm not trying to hold this business down either. I'm a Soldier who asked a business to honor their word which they did not. I ask anyone looking to join this gym to examine their contract and be aware of what they are actually agreeing to. And if you are a fellow service member, DO NOT support this company since they do not support us. 
Let me reiterate that my experience with Fasi Sports is NOT a reflection of Las Vegas Athletic Club. LVAC is an awesome gym with great facilities who always provided great service. They are a reputable business who honored the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act. Thanks Yelp for providing a forum to warn others of places like this.",22,1,0

You have to pay 0.50 for water which is weird and you're not able to bring ""outside drinks"" But other than that my boyfriend & I really enjoyed it! 
We ordered 1lb of shrimp, with all of the spices in it and it is delicious when dipped in the juices in the bag and eaten with rice. We also ordered the chicken tenders basket and mild cajun fries. We could have appreciated more spice to our fries, and I wouldn't recommend ordering the chicken tenders basket because the chicken fingers are more like giant chicken nuggets (they dont really have the consistency of real chicken fingers if you know what I mean) 

Also, they don't have any plates or anything so  if you grew up with traditional Filipino families (ie: use hands to eat EVERYTHING) then you'll feel like you're at home. 
I was craving boiling crab again 9 days later, and so my boyfriend took me and this time we had 1lb of shrimp, rice, the catfish basket, and the gumbo with rice.

We had reservations and there was really no wait (less than 5 minutes). The decor of the place is adorable and the stylists all seemed really nice. That being said, I think it was pretty hit or miss on their ability based on how people were walking out. Some people looked great and others, not so much. 

I have long hair, on the thin side, but it holds a curl extremely well. I asked for the cosmo tai and ended up with long loose curls, but not a lot of volume. I really liked it...but as it fell throughout the rest of the night, I ended up with a mass of overly hairsprayed hair. 

The biggest issue I had was that while blow drying my hair with a round brush, my stylist kept getting my hair stuck in the brush and tugging to get it out. I noticed another patron sitting across from me whose stylist was doing the same thing to her.  The thing is, my normal stylist (who trims and colors and all that) could do this blow out in his sleep...with no tangles or stuck brushes. 

About the hit or miss...half of the girls in our groups looked FANTASTIC and loved their styles, and half weren't that impressed. One even put her hair up after we left because she didn't like her ringlets.

So we went to the pool and threw around the balls in the shallow area when my friend was told to put her 6x8 purse in the locker since purses aren't allowed by the poolside. Oh, but my 4x6 ""clutch"" was okay because I was wearing it. I've NEVER heard of that rule EVER. Not to mention... LOCKERS ARE 40 BUCKS?! Even her purse wasn't worth that much! Outrageous. Drinks weren't allowed in the pool either. Basically they were picking on the girls, probably because we were the only ones there. Off to Encore Beach Club we went. At least the $20 my bf paid was made up for in free drinks.

Overall, too much hype, too many rules, and not even worth $20 to get in. Save your money.",4,0,0

The appetizer platter had 2 kinds of baked oysters - very small in size but somewhat tasty, a scallop skewer - also just OK and a shrimp brochette which was shrimp wrapped in bacon.

Our upgraded RV was old and tattered.  One of the couches swayed from side to side when driving and the arm rest constantly fell off, it has a huge metal piece on it to hold it in that is extremely dangerous when it falls.  The seats where the table is had cushions that did not stay on while driving.  Only one side had seat belts.  The side of the panel does not hang right and is falling off the side, the other side was stapled on with large exposed staples we had to cover so our 2 year old didn't cut herself.  The drapes next to the sink were dirty with food, the blinds in back did not stay on the window.  The RV did not have a privacy screen so at night we had to cover it with a blanket so people could not see in.  The screen door did not have a screen on the door handle part so we could not leave the door open while sleeping or someone could walk in with the exposed handle.

- Decor is modern--for now. I can easily see it being dated after only a couple of years; dark wood everywhere. I'm not sure what look or theme they were going for exactly: Dark wood and random ventilation duct covers?

- P!ss poor ventilation despite the plethora of what looked like ventilation duct covers lining random column supports and walls. For a new casino, this is inexcusable. Tobacco smoke just stays in the air, choking off the lungs of non-smokers like me. I couldn't breathe without coughing when people at the next table were smoking. I don't have this problem at the other new casino resorts (e.g., Wynn, Encore, Palazzo, Venetian, Bellagio, etc.).

Roasted mushrooms: I love mushrooms, but I was not a fan of the dish.  I thought the mushrooms were over seasoned and way too peppery.  The portion was small and not worth the price.

First I think $$ sign by yelp is quite miss leading. I'm a small eater yet for me to get full in this place with a pint of beer will easily cost me $30-40.  Items are cheap but you will have to order ALOT to get full for this reason.  

This is by far the most fancy schpancy yakitori place I've ever been to yet highly priced items are not quite living up to its expected quality.  Wings probably were my favourite but the inclusion of wing tip was bit of a disappointment and big part of the skin being very soft and mushy was not impressive.  What happened to crispy skin from charcoal grill people?  A separate order of chicken skin was crispy but it had undesirable chicken smell to it and my wife was immediately taken aback.  Pork belly was little too dry considering how succulent it can be when cooked right,  which isn't at the level of rocket science and same as chicken thigh pieces.  Tacowasa was good though but being in a yakitori place,  I expected to be semi {at the very least} blown away by yakitori of at least few items but I left the place,  once again defeated with disappointment which led me to get online,  and order me an electric yakitori grill straight from Japan off of eBay.

I think when it comes to yakitori,  Ju Izakaya by j-town up in Steeles and woodbine still holds its own.  Little pricey but I still can't forget the wings I had there.  Simply amazing! 

I wouldn't recommend kintori for anyone with slightly higher than average expectation from having had yakitori in Japan or at some decent places in major cities of North America.  But if you must try,  don't go here to get full,  but may be in half empty stomach. 

If any of you guys know of good yakitory places in the city, could you please send me some recommendations?

Counting down the day I get my grill. Woot!",3,2,2

Dear David Copperfield, if you think you can get away with the ENTIRE second act consisting entirely of a cheap and half-working animatronic blue alien, a tragically written (if you can even call that writing) story and a large flying drone (which is supposed to be the big wow?!), and on top of that not give a damn about any of it then you are sorely mistaken.

We were originally going to do something low key but my bestie said since it was our first we should go all out. We decided to get a custom cake about 10 days before the party. I messaged 4 bakeries. Two were unable to do it on short notice and the third was more expensive than Lesley's, so we went with her. 

Everything started off well. Lesley was nice and responded to emails to promptly, which I really appreciate. We ended up dropping the gender envelope (neither of us knew the gender) off a day late and she didn't have a problem with it. 

The cake we ordered, as you can see from the pics, was supposed to be square not rectangular. It's based off the cube in Mario Bros. I was a bit disappointed since the cake wasn't cheap, but it was still cute. 

The real problem came when we cut into the cake. About an inch of frosting on the outside was white and the inside was such a pale pink we had to go and get the envelope to double check. I guess I had really high expectations, since this is our first and it was supposed to be so special. We were just supposed to cut into it and see the brightly colored pink or blue frosting and be celebrating along with our friends and family. Instead we were scrambling to cut further into the cake and figure out what color it was. If you look closely at the middle of cake you can see the pink but everything looked white to the people watching on FB live and standing on the far edge of my kitchen. It just really put a damper on the whole experience. 

The cake itself was good, everyone seemed to like it but it was too sweet for me. My definition of white cake is apparently different from theirs, because the cake was yellow and very dense, rather than white and fluffy. 

Based on the reviews I'm sure if you went with one of their other cakes you'd be happy, but I can't recommend them for gender reveals.",2,1,0

A week before my birthday I went to the salon to have my hair cut and colored. The girl who did my hair's name was April. She started off with my color which was supposed to be low lights and some highlights and dark underneath. When she finished my hair instead of having low lights I had the most disgusting green tinged brown streaks all throughout my head. There were no highlights. she said she didn't have time to fix it that day and to call and schedule it for another day. When I called back she told me she didn't have any openings for two weeks!  I was so shocked. I told her she ruined my hair and she needed to fix it before my birthday. But she still did nothing. She offered me an appointment time that was 16 days away. I couldn't believe I was charged 125$ to have my hair turned poop green. I never bothered going back to have her fix the horrible job she did. Which was probably for the best. She was so rude and unprofessional. I would never recommend this salon to anyone.,5,0,1

This is, hands down, one of the best.  We were on our way to an orchard off Rte 28 this weekend and decided to give David's Diner a try after seeing the awesome Yelp reviews. 

Those five stars are well-deserved.

Before I address the food, let's talk about the service.  Competent, so friendly, warm, and welcoming.  Our server was great and the owner greeted us when she came by as though we were welcome friends.  This wasn't a place that made you feel like a first-timer.  The people working here were truly lovely.

The food--Hangover pancakes (choc chip) were tasty, fluffy, not overly sweet, and hearty.  Stack of two was plenty of food. My husband said his (big) corned beef and Swiss omelet was one of the best breakfasts he has had and the peppers and onions added to his homefries were delicious.  I had corned beef hash and eggs, which was not on the menu, but mentioned by our server, and it was excellent.  The corned beef was tender, lean, delicious and was griddled with thinly sliced potatoes and a little cream, I think.  So very good.

They did an amazing job with the interior design of this restaurant; it seems like a never ending labyrinth of cool things stashed everywhere. Unfortunately the high cool factor does not outweigh the ""just fine"" food. 

I tried 4 dishes, the cauliflower, their take on Banh Mi, bucheron (a cheese and beets dish), and one of the nightly specials, a veal and polenta dish. The winner of the 4 was the cauliflower dish, it was an awesome combination of textures, saltiness, creaminess, freshness. This dish was the winner of the night. All other were just OK. Their play on the Banh Mi is a pork terrine with Bahn Mi flavors. Until I went back and read the description I never would have known that this was supposed to resemble a Banh Mi. The bucheron was fine, and the veal and polenta dish tasted just like a decent pot roast. There just wasn't anything about the food that makes me want to rush back here.

He said it was worth the drive of going all the way to the Southeast part of town.  Got here on a weekday lunch after 1pm and the place was still pretty packed.  I guess these must be the employees of the local companies.  Decor-wise, the place is very minimalist, a few paintings of Japanese theme to set the mood with white walls and standard track lighting.  

I got the Ronin burger, parmesan fries, and the iced matcha green tea.  From least favorite, the matcha green tea was not sweetened and I didn't really get a strong matcha taste when drinking it.  It just tasted different as the tea I got from formal Japanese restaurants.  As for the Ronin burger, it was polished off...quickly!  The slaw, egg, and the burger really mixed well.  The only thing I wished for was maybe for a crispier bun.  The bun was a fresh, soft, warm bun but if I do come back here, I may ask them to toast my bun if possible.  The parmesan fries were also great!  I didn't even need the ketchup looking sauce that came with.  I did try it and the sauce really didn't help to enhance the flavors of the fries. 

Except for a few things that I nitpick about, I'm ready to sign up to Bachi Burger's fan club.  They have a large beer list but all of them are bottles including Hitachino which has been a favorite of mine lately.  Lastly, the prices are a bit on the pricy side but the quality and the uniqueness of their product is worth it in my opinion.

Today I went in for lunch and they had lunch specials ranging from $5.95 to $6.95 ($1.50 more for steamed vegetables), I recommend getting the steamed vegetables though you may not be able to finish it. 

Family ordered two chilli chickens and one bombay chicken, with veggies and spring roll. Received incredible service as before and great food. Crispy, Non-greasy, quality ingredients,  what more can you ask?!?! 

We paid our bill with a generous tip, and left. 

However when we were in our car, Tom ran out to catch is before we left. Turns out we paid $20.00 more on a $29 bill excluding tips (I hate those plastic bills). 

Again incredible serivce, honest management, great food, what more can you ask! So if you are in a mood for hakka chinese, GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!

It never disappoints and always has a great variety of food. The last time i was here was about 5 years ago and i heard from some friends that they did a little make over and added alot more food as well. Woah, wait how can they possiby fit anymore food stations in here, they have almost every kind of food knowen to man errr women to be matter of fact! But i guess not!  We decided to start our buffet challange here. And let me tell you when you come to the Carnival make sure you have alot of patience because it takes a little while to actually get seated. When we arrived after paying for our dealio, we stood in line for a good 20-25minutes waiting to be seated along with the other's who were also waiting in line. It seemed like it was slow inside the buffet and there were tables and booths that were open. Maybe they were understaffed that day. There was one hostess who was working the three lines of people. One at a time she would ask how many in the party then let you go, wait another 5 mintues then go to the next line and repeat! Come on lady we have 4 very hungry Yelper waiting to get their hungry hungry hippo on!!!  At last we were finally seated.
Out waiter was nice, took our orders for drinks (non alcoholic). It took him a little while but we finally got our order. If you want alcoholic drinks the bar is located in the middle of the buffet and is pretty reasonable priced. They have drink special just about every half hour as well.

Instead of telling you what i ate: Here are some of the highlights that they have here:

Carving station that serves Prime rib and Ham. I had a slice of both, the prime rib was so overcooked that it was a challange to cut it so i gave up! The ham was cooked prefect and tasted yummy!

Mashed potatoes, ribs, and assorted vegetables

Sushi ( I wouldnt recommend it)

Hush puppies, onion rings, and shrimp,fried fish fillets,taquitos and wings

Anorexic crab legs, peel-and-eat shrimp and Scallops

A full salad bar

Pancakes, Eggs, Waffles, Bagels, Muffins, Lox, Cream Cheese, Omelettes, Hash Browns, Bacon Bacon Bacon!!

Plenty of pasta with various sauces in case you want to make your own

Pizza of all kinds

Egg rolls and various dim sum and even BBQ pork! 

Made-to-order stations were popular and served: 
Pho 
Stir-fry

Tacos that you can build yourself and quesadillas

Desserts:
A gelato bar serves eight different flavors
Various mini cheesecakes
Slices of pie and cakes
Fresh Fruit
Raspberry filled churros
Cookies
Cream Puffs
Bananas foster

They also have alot of sugar free desserts as well!!

Between the four of us we totally killed the buffet, and walked away in total buffet coma's.",8,7,9

Our waitress was probably the best waitress I've ever had. Carrie was enthusiastic, really attentive without being overbearing or annoying, and just overall super awesome. 
We came in for lunch around 1 p.m. (their lunch is until 3), and I ordered the sampler platter, but I don't really like tilapia, so I asked if I could get some calamari instead of tilapia - done, without a hassle. Mum got the crawfish lunch. The bread they bring out is amazing, by the way.
Our food was out in probably ten minutes. Not only did I have an abnormally huge portion of calamari on my plate, but our waitress brought me out all the sauces that go with the calamari - their spicy marinara and a lemon aioli that you will stare at for several minutes and wonder how an aioli can taste that good. Yup. Several minutes.
Our waitress checked in on us often, and when we were done, boxed up our meal for us while we got our check. 
It was really hot out, and I was dreading walking to the car to sit on sizzling black leather seats, and before I know it BAM! There is a take-out cup for each of us, filled with our respective drink choice, our food bagged up and extra sauce for my leftoevers in little plastic take-out cups...

But they don't have upgrades like flat screen TVs.  I like that the self-parking lot is really close to the elevators that take you up to your room.  Sometimes I don't like to valet because it actually takes longer to get your car out (this is at all valets, not just Rio).  While on the topic of valets, the Rio valet guys are really, really nice, like noteworthy friendly.  Rio is also home to my family's favorite buffet, The Carnival World Buffet.  The parade in the sky show that they have above the casino every hour is fun too and I recommend anyone new to Vegas to check it out.  I also hit up the souvenir shops at the Rio for trinkets to bring home (magnets, shot glasses, mugs).  Rio also has the Sapphire pool which I believe is topless.

We figured out that the original discrepancy was due to a missing T4E slip, since I was on Mat Leave.  To this day, it is still a mystery as to where that form is.  
We only discussed my file.

Take my review with a grain of salt.  It was only my experience with this company.  This happened last year (for 2014 taxes).  I am pretty sure that we mentioned that I was on Mat Leave, since we did to the other company we had taxes done with the last time I was on Mat Leave.  I didn't remember about a T4E form, this time around.  It is possible that I didn't receive one from the government in 2015.  I could have requested it directly, if I knew it was one of the documents needed.  I collected all the other pieces of information, slips, that were brought to my attention from Triple M.

The sneaky best part of nice hotels is the big bathrooms. But I digress.

To start, the Park Hyatt in Toronto has a solid location. It's next to the Royal Ontario Museum, expensive shopping, expensive restaurants, and pretentious urbanites and tourists in their $225 Dolce & Gabbana tees. I exclude myself from this aforementioned pretentious group because I only stayed at the Park Hyatt because it was free. A perk to being a Hyatt Visa cardholder is you get an annual free night at any Hyatt in the world. That being said, prices here range in the $250 - $500 CAD range, which isn't AWFUL. But dang, I just don't think I could bring myself to pay that for any hotel. I'm not elite or rich enough to understand the reasoning, so I'll simply leave it to you to decide on the reasonableness. Although that is precisely why I became a Hyatt Visa member, so I wouldn't have to pay for rooms.

The rooms were nice, of course, although they had a bit of a dated feel to them. Carpet wasn't flush with the wall and was sorta messed up and stringy, for example. I still also hate that these types of places don't provide commentary breakfast, or anything commentary, really. Like what are we paying for? The bathroom was nice and spacious, and I always appreciate robes.

I've stayed at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo and the Hyatt Regency in Buffalo, and find the Hyatt Regency lines to be more worth the money than Park Hyatt. Well, if I paid for them, anyway lol. Actually, even the lower-tiered Hyatt Place hotels give you breakfast. If you're rich, then you aren't even reading this review. If you're just feeling splurgey, at least do some price shopping before settling on here.",1,3,2

I ordered TWO glasses of wine and he let me get the HH price, which was cool.

We ordered the full pie - Grandpa's special which was sausage, peppers and onion perfection. We were surprised when the server brought out HALF a pizza.  We wondered if the economy troubles had now reduced pizza to half a pie, but not to worry.  The remaining half stayed piping hot in the kitchen! 

The pizza was huge and delicious. We ended up taking the other half home and the way they package it for you is nothing short of perfect. We just had the other half for dinner after 10 min on the pizza stone and I cant believe how good it was.

Maybe it was the day and time that I actually came in, but I was really expecting more from this Vegas classic. The decor was basically strip club fluorescent purple tones with nothing that reminded me of Vegas of the 80's or late 70's when I used to go with my parents as a kid.

The food was good ( a step up from Denny's) and the service was decent. But the worst part of my experience was the patrons. I've never seen such a gathering of hipster douche bags with really bad tattoos - I wish I had my camera.  All I heard around me is people yelling loudly about how they had just rocked out at circus circus or partied at the stratosphere - which is not wrong, just something you don't want to be trying to show off about. My girlfriend and I couldn't even eat comfortably, so we just took our food to go.

Bottom line, if you want get the retro Vegas experience, go to downtown. Its changed, but some places like the horseshoe and especially the freemont still have that 70's and 80's Vegas feel to it. As far as the peppermill (fake retro) big disappointment, but I might try again possibly at a more reasonable time. I recommend it at least once in your life but keep you expectations low.",0,0,0

Second, it's full of art - be it the glass work displayed in the fabrication hallways, or the rotating photo gallery, or the open space which has free exhibits all year long.

I eventually came back for lunch on a Friday, and the crowd was much better. The place itself looks very nice on the inside.. definitely one of the coolest looking buffets I've been to. Atmosphere was excellent and everything was very clean.

The sushi selection was very disappointing. I usually like to start off buffet meals with a plate of sushi, but I couldn't get close to a full plate here. I only found 3-4 rolls that interested me here. I have a feeling that the sushi selection at dinner is much better. The quality of the sushi seemed to be about average as far as buffets go. The cooked foods were a little disappointing as well. Most of the options were generic Chinese dishes that I tend to avoid at buffets. The grilled section was pretty good. The best thing available here was the grilled salmon. The skin was crunchy and the fish was cooked perfectly. I also enjoyed the grilled udon. 

The noodle station was probably the highlight of the meal for me. The handpulled noodles were delicious, and the spicy soup was very tasty. There was almost always a line because they make everything to order, but it was worth waiting for. The dessert section was also really good. Everything I tried in this section was great, and I found myself wishing I had more space in my stomach to try other desserts. My favorite item in this section was probably the waffles. They had a person making waffles (4 small waffles at a time), and I thought that was a nice touch. I remember grabbing one of the freshly made waffles and inadvertently squishing it with the tongs because it was so soft. I added a scoop of vanilla ice cream to the waffle with some sprinkles, and it was amazing.

Overall, my lunch here was decent, but it definitely could've been much better. The prices seemed about right to me, and the service was on point. I'm not sure if I would come back for the lunch buffet, but I would definitely be willing to give this place a shot for dinner (assuming the parking lot isn't as crazy). The Friday night oyster special sounds pretty cool, and I hope to try it one day.",3,0,0

However it was a pleasant surprise to see a nice little patio out front with several tables inside. 

We ordered a variety of the lamb+veal and chicken doners along with two of the currywurst boxes to try. Unfortunately, they were out of the traditional bratwurst so we had the summer sausage which was equally good!

Having never had a doner - I wasn't sure what to expect as they looked like wraps but they tasted amazing! The lamb+veal was great - bread was nicely toasted and filled with fresh salad, lamb and veal topped with the trio of sauces! The currywurst brought back memories of being at the train station in Frankfurt. Loved the food. If there is one critque - it is probably the fries which were too salty and a bit soggy. Not a big deal for me as we came for the doner and sausauges but crisp fries would have make this a 5 star.

I was pumped and ready for AYCE sushi.  For me, ""sushi"" means rolls - I just don't have much interest in the other foods.  For my starter roll I always like to order a spicy tuna - as a judge for my comparison to other places.  To their credit, the Spicy Tuna roll was the largest roll I have ever seen.  I later learned (though it is not listed on the menu) that I could order half-rolls.  Honestly, one roll in and I was starting to feel full - ARGH!  It was a good roll.  

Next, I picked one of their fried roll specials - the Mexican roll.  Now this was new to me.  I've never had a fried roll.  Honestly, it just wasn't very good to me.  I should have stuck to what I know best and not deviated too far.  The roll was larger than the first one and each piece was too large to eat by itself.  Bummer.  I couldn't finish the roll - it was just too much. 

So my AYCE excitement was crashed when I could only finish one roll and a half.  I didn't get to try anything more.  Call me lame for sticking to rolls at a place like this, but it's what I prefer.  

I will add that the place just felt weird to me.  There were about 6 men working behind the counter and the kitchen - and only 3 customers.  Several of the men came out to ""catch a glimpse"" of another female customer eating by herself.  Kinda creepy.  

I wanted to really like this place, but my experience just didn't do that for me.",2,0,0

Was not that hunger as it was only 2 pm and I had just come from a business meeting near by. So I decided to go light with a sandwich and a side of my favorite okra that they make in house. Now let me describe the nearly meatless bread sandwich. Most people would call it Texas toast. Each side of this bread sandwich is about the thickness of 2 regular slices of white bread. So think of this as a standing on edge large piece of bread that has been cut in the middle to hold the meat. However the amount of meat that was placed inside
was meager to say the least. Maybe I should call this a jam sandwich....2 pieces of bread jammed together.
Bottom line...not worth the $9.95.
Plus I don't understand why they had so many employees behind the counter as the place was almost empty.

The Japanese lunch boxes are a good choice, too: they come with a little bit of sushi and a salad. The ginger dressing is unique but tasty. 

There are roll specials, too for $10. 

If I am feeling opulent, I get the Chinese lunch AND the house vegetable roll a la carte. Or a whole order of General Tso's Tofu from the main menu. I was warned that the tofu was a big order. But it was crispy on the outside, custardy on the inside and tangy good. I ate it all. I am fat.

My significant build back was completed in one day.  The employees that came to my condo were on time, professional and highly skilled.  My kitchen looks exactly the same as before the damage.  I can never tell it happened in the first place and am so satisfied to have my home back the way it was.

I met up with the date buddy at 1PM on a Monday afternoon and was out the door in less than 45 minutes (partially because we were on a time crunch since he had to go to work).

When we first walked in the door, I noticed how exceptionally busy they were.  There were unbused tables, people lining up at the cashier register to pay their bills, and no host\/hostess in sight.  I was a tad confused as to what to do, so we just waited.  Eventually, a gentleman came around and greeted us, asked us to wait for a table to be cleaned up, but then proceeded to greet the party of 4 behind us (whom he was obviously familiar with) and lead them to an open table.  I was also a tad confused to this as well.  But we eventually got seated and drinks ordered.

The menu is cutely printed on a faux newspaper, and it seemed a bit huge and overwhelming.  I didn't realize they shoved breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner all into two pages.  It was a bit much.

I ordered the eggs benedict.  The food came out super quick and was perfectly warm.  I noticed right away there were bits of bacon on my potatoes, YUM! And these were real potatoes, not frozen and reheated, but real potatoes.  That's always plus.  Then I noticed there was a GENEROUS portion of hollandaise on my eggs.  It was a tad much for me, but it was good.  My eggs were wonderfully poached and the ham was tastefully salty.

Like I said, we were out the door in 45 minutes, even after waiting to be seated and the cash register debacle of taking awhile to process our debit cards when we were checking out.  I wanted to give the restaurant 4 stars because of the food, but I had such high expectations from reading other Yelp reviews and the service did not deliver.

- Duza's is a quaint little joint in the Coronado Historic neighborhood. 
- Staff is friendly.
- Kitchen is immaculately clean.
- Optional outside seating.
- Atmosphere is very relaxed.
- Potatoes were seasoned and cooked wonderfully, lots of thyme and rosemary. 
- They have a couple vegitarian options.

Cons:
- Drinks and Pastries are not on the menu that is given at the table but instead is hanging above the register.
- If you do not eat pork for whatever reason this isn't the place to be, they rely heavily on the pork flavors to boost their dishes. 
- If you substitute the pork for turkey, like I did, I received a snide remark (from another staff member who hadn't been waiting on us) about how I'm taking the best part off the plate. (This was suppose to be taken jokingly, but I felt like I was to be ashamed that I don't eat pork products.) 
- My subsitute for the pork products (which were Jalapeno chedder sausage and bacon) was turkey and it was very very bland and was a huge disappointment and kind of haphazardly thrown on the plate.

I was given a consultation then said they couldn't give me adjustment. Few months later, I tried another Joint location, which was 9500 S. Eastern Ave #120, Henderson, NV. When I would always go in, I would be asked if I have the Joint key so they can mark me coming in and I said I never was given that and they said my home base was off Sunset Rd, Henderson, NV. 

I called up Sunset Rd about it and I talked to a Lisa Marie. I asked her about the key and she said she will get back to me. Over a week later, she never called me back so I called her office to follow up and I asked her about it and she said told someone else for them to call me, from the location Pebbles Rd, Henderson, NV. As we talked about it stating I never got a call from them, she ended up being RUDE to me and as I kept asking her questions, she 'HUNG UP' the phone. 

Later, I called the Corporate office of the Joint and I spoke to Michelle and she said she wrote to whoever to take care of it and I haven't heard from anyone on it, so another time I called them and left message to the Director, still no response. So I called back to Corp and spoke to Courtney and I said I like to try to talk to the Director and she said I can help you but I thought with her position doesn't have enough weight for this to happen and she took it personal, being a little sarcastic. 

Finally, I called the Joint off Pebbles, I spoke to Sheena. All this time, she was able to help, knock on wood, I hope that continues or she may act different to me too. Anyway, she emailed to Corp for me and finally I got a call and they said Lisa Marie did hang up on me and she was sorry to them, not me as I called back to Sheena and she said Lisa Marie was suppose to call me to apologize of last week and I told Sheena. So I called the Corp and spoke to Michelle to follow up on Lisa Marie and Michelle said wait a minute, putting me on hold. Well, she more like hung up on me and I tried calling right back and said they're closed. I called again to Corporate and they never would answer their phone. 

Today, Jan 27, I called Sheena back and said Lisa Marie never called me to apologize last week and now is a waiting game that I was suppose to get my callback from Sheena. I'm shocked the way this business is handled especially from 1311 W. Sunset Rd, Henderson, NV, that Lisa Marie till this day is still with them...but I noticed that after I reported Lisa Marie first time, I was calling up for Sheena one day and Lisa Marie answered the phone there at Pebbles and she was so so nice...couldn't believe that...but I know it's a game playing with Corp and Lisa Marie or else she doesn't care why I never got her call for apology. 

This is a such a sad world. I told one of the Joints locaiton, people should be proud to have a job because the way the economy is, there are homeless people standing almost every corner. Even Corp has some attitudes, as well. I'm surprised they're in business this long. FYI..few other Joint locations operate their own so few of them do not fall under the Corp.

She was super helpful in answering my question because I have a big living room and Its hard to get a candle scent to fill the entire room and she definitely directed me into something that could help with my problem, scented oils!

HOWEVER, I'm extremely disappointed in the oil place here. I've come here quite a few times for a car wash and I have never  been unsatisfied so this time as I was pulling in, I saw a banner hanging that said an oil change was 19.95 and included a basic wash for a few extra dollars or something to that effect. Since I needed an oil change anyway, I decided to get it done all in one shot. Now, my car is a Volkswagen so I am aware that it is more expensive... What I was a little shocked at was that the attendant rudely told me it was 67.99 plus tax...  I was already there so I just went with it. I go to check out and after a $3 dollar car wash upgrade, my total is almost $93 DOLLARS!!! When I ask the guy WHY???, he proceeds to tell me that the 67.99 package only includes a certain amount of oil and my car takes more than that so they have to charge me for the extra oil. If he already knew that going in, why didn't he just quote me the full amount? He also told me it would only take 30 minutes and an hour later... It's done. It's so frustrating and manipulative. I won't be back again, not because of the price but because this attendant treated me really rudely and then wasn't even honest!!!",0,0,0

Chicken Katsu - I know this might sound weird, but this was probably the healthiest tasting Chicken Katsu I have ever had. I think it was the quality of the chicken and amount in each bite. I am used to a katsu that is mainly breading, so this dish was different from the rest. The dipping sauce was awesome. It leans towards the sweeter side which is a plus in my book.

BBQ Beef - The marinade for this dish was on point. It was DELICIOUS. I couldn't get enough of it.

Spam Masubi - I need to find out the recipe of the sauce the Spam was dipped in. It was extremely good.

I love this place. The meat is great, the marination is a little sweet but Americans would love them. The meat that they give you is frozen. Like they had a frozen block of meat and cut them right before they give it to you so the meat is frozen when they bring it to you. 
The salad is great, a little salty but still good. A long with the kimchi, salty but good. Their other sides are pretty good as well. I love love the pickled cucumber.
And I don't know if it's an Asian thing or it's just them but they're very ""not attentive"" if that makes sense. Like they could careless about their customers. Every time we asked for something, they always give us this ""ugh, again?"" face. I'm Asian myself and I've worked with a lot of customers but I would never do that. They're stingy and doesn't want to give you the food. I had to order brisket and beef tongue like 3 times before I got them. If they were busy I would understand but no one was there. They just seemed very careless. 
Food quality wise, it's very good and delicious. 
Customer service wise, it was pretty bad. 
They charged us the 18% gratuity and there was only 4 of us in our party so that's another thing. I don't mind tipping at all, I really don't. I do it according to the service that was provided but the service was pretty bad. 
Usually I give more then 18% but since they want just 18% I just let them.

I checked in around 5pm and after working all day I just wanted to get to my room and relax before the dinner party.  My room was on the opposite side of the hotel and after I finally found my room, the key didn't work.  I picked up the lobby phone to call the front desk, it didn't work either.  One of the hotel staff members was walking by and saw my frustrations but didn't stop and ask if I needed help...he kept walking.  I flagged him down and asked if he could assist me, he said he didn't know anything about the cards and as he walked away (again) I asked if he could contact the service desk, he kept walking and said I'd have to go back to the lobby.  I had to walk all the way back to the lobby with my bags to get another key, I explained to the front desk attendant that the card didn't work, she didn't apologize.,....just handed me the new key and that was it. She didn't offer to have someone help me with my bags, nothing.  After finally getting into my room it was very nice, clean, gorgeous modern decor, the bathroom and shower were very large, but for $200 a night it should be.  The only complaints I have is the staff and the horrible smoke!  The hotel staff is a bit rude and lacking in customer service to say the least.  The cloud of hotel smoke hits you as soon as you walk into the lobby, it's everywhere!

Our delightful server Megan suggested we try the Red Neck Tacos to start, claiming that we probably never had anything like them before.  She was absolutely right! The tacos are delicious soft corn pancakes topped with tender pulled pork, jalapeno slaw with sweet and smoky sauce. A fantastic combination, and would have been enough for my dinner alone, maybe with a side, but I had to share with my hubby, who also raved about this unique dish.

For his main course, hubby had the baby back ribs. They were finger-licking good! He claims to be a baby back aficionado, and when he finished his first rib with a Cheshire Cat grin, I knew I had to have a bite even though I have never been a fan of the baby backs myself . . . I am a convert, at least at Porkopolis! I ordered the Barbecue Salmon which came with polenta cakes and fresh veggies. I am always a little hesitant to order salmon out because even when I ask for it to be prepared on the rarer side, it never comes out right. I was even more hesitant here knowing that it had to be cooked and then recooked on the grill. Much to my satisfaction, out came a beautifully done hefty piece of salmon cooked to perfection. I opted to have it prepared with the sweet and smoky sauce instead of the hot and spicy, and it was yummy! The polenta cake had a hint of cheese, and was very creamy in texture, a great match for the salmon! The macaroni and cheese was equally creamy. Loved that it had a ""crust"" on top.

Both owners, Matt and Brady, came around to greet us and see how we were enjoying the meal. They engaged us in some great banter, commented on my picture-taking . . . ""Are you tweeting?"" ""No, Yelping!"" Then I told them they already had two 5-star reviews!  Unlike Brianna, I found the service to be spot on, especially for a restaurant that opened less than two weeks ago. Our server was attentive and on the ball. We never had to ask for a tea refill. We also were thanked by not only our server and the owners, but also by the other servers. Either they heard you Brianna, or you didn't hear them when you left???

By the way, we picked up a bottle of sweet and smoky on our way out. If we can't get to Porkopolis as often as we like, we can bring a little Porkopolis to our home. I can't wait to try it on some chicken, Highly unlikely we could find baby backs even close to the fall of the rib, though.",4,1,3

I have had such good luck with Yelp, but have had more than one less than positive experiences in the past few weeks with highly, highly recommended restaurants.  I hate to give a negative review, but if I had read anything close to what we experienced, I would not have spent a lot (a lot) of money at Eleven.

I am originally from Pittsburgh and now live outside DC.  My husband and 2 sons (age 19 and 16) Went to Eleven solely based on Yelp reviews on a recent visit to Pittsburgh when we were able to take some time away from family events.  I love the Strip, so we  headed to Eleven which, Yelpers, sounded great  - people talked about cozy booths and wooden beams, etc... I was, therefore,  unprepared for the dark, stark, industrial nature of the place.  Yes, it is in keeping with the city and the vibe of the Strip, but I found the whole place to be loud, cold and impersonal.  Opposite of cozy.    

The worst thing really was the odor that hit us as we entered.  Kind of a whiff of wet garbage, maybe?  All 4 of us smelled it immediately, and it was not inviting.  The hostess looked at us like we were crazy.  We had a drink in the bar. (There are TV's.  Why?  ISn't this a classy place?)

Smell was in the bar, and in the restaurant but fainter.

Honestly, I don't even remember the specifics of the food.  A lot of it was tasty, for sure. All of it was overpriced for Pittsburgh.  I've been in so many similar restaurants in major cities, I guess Pittsburgh is just catching up.  Maybe I don't like seeing the generic pretentious foodiness in a city that is famous for fries on sandwiches?  That's my problem, for sure.

It was expensive, by any measure.  I was actually angry I spent so much on an experience that would have been considered highly average where ever it was.

It's simple: buy a bucket of golf balls, carry them and your clubs to the designated area, and then start swinging away. I think it was pretty inexpensive - you can get a bucket of 100 balls for $10. There are a few benches out there for sitting, but nothing designated for each bay.

Sat in the bar, prime rib was thin, not like the thick slices we enjoyed in the old days, have been coming here for 15 years more or less, called for manager to verify the price, she did come over but was cold and said they were going according to Corporate, when we checked in they knew it was our anniversary, yet after finishing our dinner reminded our waitress it was our anny and she gave us $25.00 towards our next meal---don't know if they still do it, but Morton's used to print out a special menu with our names on it and take our picture--Flemings---so disappointed tonight with the meal and your service---please review your service---I will use up my gift certificate but will not be going back to the North Scottsdale location!",0,0,0

But after eating here I am confused and a little disappointed.

The good:
The restaurant is really nicely decorated and have a Spa like feel to it and I love that!
The owner is really nice and sincere when he takes out order and give us recommendation and I always love good services!
Good, Clean washrooms, I really like that.. hardly any vietnamese places I been to have washrooms that clean!

The bad:
The food here is just to greasy. Everything are deep fried.. Even the Lemongrass Chicken with Coconut Milk are deep fried until the chicken are so dried out! The Cha Ca tasted ok but did not Wow me. The Fish sauce they served here is really weak, taste more like coloured water.

Since the restaurant was full with a big group of 30 people ordering the same time, the kitchen might be stressed out and thus affect the quality of food?

I might give the other Hanoi 3 Seasons a try but for sure I am not coming back to Queen Street location anytime soon.

After reading previous reviews, I called and asked for Zane (Zain?).  He was off that day, and I really needed the AC system looked at.  

I was connected to Blake Bootsma-Alvarez.  He was very helpful and professional.  We set the appointment.  My college-age son has the car in Las Vegas for the summer.  He is doing an internship and noticed the AC wasn't blowing very cold.  It's 110 degrees outside, so we knew we needed to get some help.  He delivered the car to Blake and the complimentary shuttle got him to work early.  (Great job!)

Blake and his team got the problem diagnosed quickly and called me back to inform me of the situation.  He was:

1.  Well prepared for the conversation
2.  Professional and succinct
3.  Clear in explaining my options
4.  Able to give an accurate estimate of the cost for the service

I gave the go-ahead and he said he should have it done in about two hours.  

The call came less than two hours later, and Blake gave me an accurate description of the diagnostics that were performed and the resultant work that was done to correct the problem.  He also cleaned up a few other minor issues, no extra charge.  That was much appreciated, and I felt he did his best to look out for my son, and for us. 

What more could I want in a Service Department?   Excellent communication, good work completed in a timely manner and all for a good price.  

I would take my car to AutoNation Nissan Las Vegas without hesitation.  Wouldn't hurt to ask for Blake as he did a great job for us!",0,0,0

jZZMYS8_EuOPaseYtHlRgA,AeqRXsmY1iKMTh8fAFi6nw,xXzGPEk3OWiQ1Q9oaH9CqQ,2,2015-07-19,"You know, for years, I've recommended this spa as *THE* spa to go to in Vegas. And I still feel that way (re: the facilities), BUT here is what you need to know:  I suggest that you pay the (approx. $80) to access the facilities for the day -- bring a book, bring some magazines (since they don't really provide any -- even the Fantastic Sams $20 haircut place has magazines?!), relax on the heated seats, sauna, jaccuzzi, ""shower journeys"", etc., and have a wonderful time relaxing. 

What I do NOT recommend is getting a treatment, especially not a facial. 

A few notes:

1) They say on their website that everyone gets a ""welcoming foot ritual"", and there's a picture of someone getting a foot bath \/ foot massage (page  8 of their spa menu PDF on their website). Well, they don't actually do that. I don't care that they don't do it, but I do care that it's implied that everyone gets a sort of mini-foot massage when they don't.

2) As several others have noted, you do *NOT* get the full time you think you will. No one in our party got the *full* time of treatment (e.g. 80 or 90 minutes). Reading others' reviews, I think the ""time rituals"" people get the most gypped. They include the ""walking to the room, getting settled in to your bed,"" etc., in the total time. So, figure that the actual treatment time will be 10 - 15 minutes less than what you book. 

3) When I called to book my facial, I was originally going to get the ""Oxygen Facial"". I told the woman on the phone that my primary concern was congestion, and that the #1 thing I wanted from the facial was extractions.  She told me that if I wanted extractions, that I should instead get another facial, which is, YOU GUESSED IT: $60 more expensive.  I wasn't thrilled about paying for the more expensive facial, but I did have a lot of congestion I wanted cleared up, so I agreed. 

She said, ""I will note here in your [file? reservation?] that your primary concern is congestion, and that you want to have a lot of extractions. Your aesthetician will be aware of this, and will be sure to focus on it.""  Great!

Well -- during the facial, I sort of zoned out, and remember wondering, ""Hmm, I wonder when the extractions are going to start?  I guess....I guess they'll be done later?"".... well, you guessed it -- we got to the end of the facial (I did sort of snooze off, I think), and no extractions. 

I had been explicitly told when I booked that ""Oh, you need this [$260] facial instead of the [$200] facial if you want extractions, and I'll make a note here for your technician to be aware of this."" 

I feel as though I was up-sold to a more expensive service under false pretenses. Surely if a spa as fancy as the MO says ""I have made a note and your aesthetician will be sure to focus on congestion \/ extractions"", then I trusted that this would actually be conveyed \/ followed. It's the freakin' Mandarin! Such a basic instruction \/ service level would be a GIVEN at any of their Asian properties, I can assure you. 

4) My partner got a massage, and said that the massage pressure was a bit too light, and that he asked her *twice* to please use more pressure, and she didn't.

Again, for a spa like the MO, especially one charging $280 for a massage, if the person says, ""I'd like a little more pressure please"", then YOU DO THAT. 

I can't believe that the $19.99 foot spas in L.A. are more responsive to client requests than the MO.  Similarly, a $40 facial at any of my local beauty spots will do extractions if requested. 


Again -- the facilities themselves are wonderful. I do plan to come back, but next time, we will just pay to access the facilities and spend a relaxing afternoon in the laconium, heated seats, etc.  

But I can not, in good conscience, recommend the services. Especially not considering the price. Sorry.",26,0,0

The chips and salsa were okay.  My bf and I split the cheese crisp with beef (first mistake).  The beef looked grey  and the cheese looked old and overcooked.

Gordon Ramsey needs to take over and revamp this place.  The location is prime but it seems like they were just being lazy all around.

Amaya is not the least expensive, but I find the value fair.  The food tastes authentic enough without being excessively oily.

I liked the sour beer and the IPA the most, the only one I thought was questionable was the beets flavored beer. 
Then again, I'm not a fan of beets and I was not the one to order it, so I can't really say much, other than how popular it was shocked me a bit. 

I really want to try the Jess pizza, which sounds amazing and com back for a few more beers. The pricing was a little high for my taste, but then again I would go to local breweries and spend 4-5 dollars on a pint.

The food is generally pretty good but on multiple occasions I've gone there at later hours and noticed the chips to be extremely stale to the point where you can't really eat them. The salsa is good but not my favorite. The entrees I've had are always the best part though, which it always should be. I typically get the stacked enchiladas with shredded beef, which is good but could have more flavor, with rice and beans. On other occasions I've had a chicken chimichanga which was also good. Compared to some other Mexican restaurants, I can say there are other tastes out there that I prefer. 

If they could make sure to have fresh chips and salsa the entire time they're open, I'd give them at least one more star. The food is good, but isn't out of this world amazing.

No more big sales the employees seem unhappy and the quality has went downhill. Last night at the deli my wife and I asked for meat to be cut special . The girl working started mumbling under her breath and slamming things around. Another girl said to her I am going to clean the slicer she said good luck isn't Giant Eagle open. The one girl said that's not right that's the competition. The angry girl said so what if they psy me better I will care.

But, since they started pushing the AYCE option, the service and the food quality have gone WAY down. I had noticed that the fish had started tasting not as fresh, and the service had been starting to slip for a while now, but the last visit was so bad that I had to write about it. For starters, the staff was not organized. We kept getting asked, by five different waiters, what we wanted to order. We opted out of the all you can eat, so the we could relax & enjoy our meal, and take home leftovers. But, they didn't communicate with each other, so we kept getting interrupted by new people asking us what we wanted. The spicy tuna roll that we ordered was way too spicy, the ponzu sauce was too sour & not the citrusy tart flavor that it should've been, and the rice didn't stick together at all (Sushi Making 101). The staff were running into each other and the customers. Two employees were talking about going out & getting drunk on one side of me, on the other side, an Eastern European employee was trying, unsuccessfully, to hit on a waitress (""I don't bite..."")  At the end of the meal, we were asking one waiter to bring us a box for our leftovers, while another came over and started dumping our food onto a tray to take away.

I felt compelled to dress up for this place because of the ""high end"" aura it has.  But really, there is no such dress code for this place.  You will not feel sorry for dressing up, but don't feel intimidated if you're just in jeans.  It isn't one of those places that will kick you out or have a bouncer tell you you're stylishly-challenged.

The room is quite nice.  two floors and an easy lounge that is strategically set up for tight squeezes and excellent people watching while mingling with your own group.  there are enough microspaces to mingle with strangers and if that's not overt enough for you there is a communal table on the second floor.

Now the vodkas.  they have a menu.  it is large.  they have a large bar that is lined with, yes, vodka.  Because I gave up vodka when I was 17 (heh..yeah), I decided I would just let the bartender reccommend whatever drink (all the well knowing she could have recommended a 50$drink) just because I know if I do choose to come back here this will likely be my last vodka-based drink.  It's one of those things you just need to try just because it is available.

I gave her a list of qualities I like in a drink (not sweet, dry, simple) and I asked her to reccomment a martini.  I forget the name of the drink but she used a vodka from iceland.  It was a martini done real (too often bars turn martinis into sweet cocktails- real martinis should really just be vodka and vermouth).  the martini was $15 and it was good.

If 15$ is too steep, they also have 5-7$ options that are more on the cocktaily end but definitely not watered down with sweet fillers.  They were quality too.

After the 15$ martini that I nursed for a good half hour (vodka was smooth and good but I still can't say I'm gonna go back to it) I ordered wine.  the glass of house wine was also 15$.
This is defnintely not a place to be a regular at unless you have a bay street bank account.

The vibe:
red room, late twenties to 40s crowd.  dressed very up and some dressed for an average pub.  
crowd wasn't especially pretty, which is what I expected, but there were a couple that I glanced at more than once.

After reading some not so great reviews of Maxi's Cafe I went in with low expectations and the hope I was going to find something positive to make me see it in a good light, but unfortunately it wasn't to be.

There is nothing super bad about Maxi's cafe, the food isn't awful, the service isn't terrible, but in no way is it good either.

I met a friend their for lunch, whilst I was waiting outside for 5 mins there were two empty tables waiting to be cleared, 5 mins later one was cleared and the staff did not seem anywhere near busy. When we went to the counter to order one girl was opening a box and didn't look our way, two more were chatting in the kitchen. After about a minute waiting we were served and the girl was friendly enough, but didn't seem to know what I ordered was and it took someone else to help her out a bit (chargrilled chicken panini, choice of only about 7 sandwiches, wasn't that difficult). 

The food arrived for my friend and I a few minutes later during a nice conversation and the conversation was interrupted by me wincing at the salad dressing. Balsamic vinegar and some kind of oil (didn't taste like olive oil) that was just too sour without savoury or sweet to make it better (I make a much nicer olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, honey an whole grain mustard with sea salt and pepper dressing at home). Also, there was what I think a tree leaf in my salad, not sure if it was to make an intentional autumn feeling or a window was open in the kitchen, but it just shouldn't have been there.

The panini, really underwhelming. Perhaps I should have put the leaf in it. Didn't detect any hint of any char grilling, just a cheddar and salsa gloop that made the bread soggy. 

Order a coffee a well, wasn't too bad, preferable to Costa but not as good as Starbucks, hence a two stars instead of 1, but it was touch and go.

If I ever get invited again (I won't be going out of choice) I might try the soup or play it safe and get a beer from the fridge.

We thought we had made reservations for Bremner but it turns out we had booked the reservation for Monday instead of Saturday. So w e needed a restaurant super last minute and something in the old port. I didn't want to go to just any restaurant. The reviews for this place online were good so we took a chance and called and luckily they had tables available. We got there at 9:30pm and I would say the restaurant was about half full. 

I ordered the chardonnay and then a pinot grigio. They were both good. The waitress didn't let me try the chardonnay before she gave me my glass which I thought was unusual. But the waiter who served me the pinot grigio let me try it first but perhaps it was because I asked to try it. I do like the wines here. I tried my boyfriend's glass of red wine and it was very good. The wine menu by the glass was written on a chalk board. 

They gave on small plate with two free Bruschetta. It was very good! I politely waited for my boyfriend to arrive before eating one but I think it would have been even better if I had eaten it right away because then the crunchy baguette would have been even crunchier. 

We both ordered from the MTL a Table menu. My boyfriend ordered the beet soup but he didn't like it. We switched entrees but I didn't like the soup either and after awhile I gave up on trying to eat it. I'm not a big fan of beets to begin with. I only eat beet salad because its healthy. 
I had ordered the salmon gravlax with red onions, fennel and capers. That was good. 

For mains my boyfriend had the rigatoni with tomato sauce and melted smoked gouda cheese and I had the pork shank on a bed of pumpkin risotto. The rigatoni wasn't what I expected at all. It looked more like a lasagna to me. It was tasty though but I would have preferred it with a meat sauce and some chili flakes. The pork shank was a definite winner. The meat fell easily off the bone. The risotto was good and didn't taste like pumpkin at all. Both portions were huge which I like.  My boyfriend could not finish his rigatoni. 

For dessert I had the homemade pumpkin ice cream with walnuts. It was so good! Think pumpkin spiced latte but in ice cream form! My boyfriend had the Sicilian cannoli. I honestly don't know what the difference between a Sicilian cannoli and a regular cannoli is. All I know is that there were two small cannolis on a plate. One was pistachio and the other was lemon. The pistachio was good but I didn't really enjoy the lemon one because it was too lemony for me. 

For $31 for three services I felt it was worth it. Besides the beet soup the food was good. The restaurant was nicely decorated. There were tons of art on display for purchase. If I was in the area I think I would come back and try something from their regular menu like perhaps the truffle penne or maybe I would go back for some wine and some antipasti.",2,2,2

Unfortunately, I haven't found anywhere in Toronto that does a really good one. Some coworkers recommended Ace Bakery due to its proximity to our office, so I ventured out recently to give it a try. 

The soup of the day didn't sound overly appealing to me that day, so I just ordered a sandwich. I was craving smoked salmon, but when I asked for it without dill, they said it's pre-made and already mixed in. Ok, pass. I chose the Italian grilled cheese instead. 

When I opened the sandwich, I could barely make out any cheese inside. I found the bread to be too thick for the amount of cheese and it was quite dry as a result. I also felt the type of bread was a bit too overpowering for a grilled cheese, but this is just my personal preference and I'm sure many others would disagree. 

It was ok, but I prefer a place that allows you to build your own sandwich. This place is better suited to people who want something quick and are not overly picky about what's in their sandwich.",2,0,0

They give you sour dough bread which is fine.
We ordered the rib eye that comes with truffle butter and garlic mashed potatoes. You can get a soup or salad. If you get a seafood bisque it's extra (but they don't tell you how much. It's $6). My coworker ordered the wedge salad which had half blue cheese and rasp vinaigrette dressing. 

Rib eye. Supposed to be succulent and melts in your mouth deliciousness. NOT. Because it was $34 we kept trying it but the butter didn't compliment the steak. The mashed potatoes were old and dry. We both didn't finish our steaks and I took mine home just because I felt bad to waste food but I won't eat it again.

When the waitress came back to clear the table, my co worker said she didn't like the steak so she offered us a complimentary dessert. We selected the Guinness chocolate cake. Well, that came and it looked really dry. And when we tasted it, it was.

The obvious comparison: Mandarin. I will give the slight edge to Mandarin in the food quality\/taste department. Decor\/ambience...well, they're both buffets but Mandarin gets the edge here easily. The biggest difference, to me, are the staff. Mandarin servers\/greeters\/et al are much friendlier, more outgoing and pretend to actually be pleased to see you patronizing their workplace.

The surly attitudes at Imperial need to go. Nary a smile to be seen from their servers. Ignore you when you thank them for filling up your water. 

Food wise, there is much more selection at Imperial, but it seems the selection comes at the cost of taste. Again, I'm not expecting a gourmet experience here but the dishes are just...meh. Nothing mindblowing, but not gross or offensive in any way. They do keep the stuff pretty hot and fresh at least. 

Sushi is usually surprisingly good considering it's a Chinese buffet. 

Desserts are all obviously storebought. I am a fan of the waffles though (they make them way too slow at Mandarin and there never seem to be any!) 

Parking is easy enough, though Tuesday evenings can be a bit of a headache as it's right beside the theater. 

To sum up...if this location closed, I'd happily welcome a different buffet in it's place at a similar price point. But it gets the job done for now when the family is in the mood to pig out on ""Chinese food"" for slightly cheaper than at Mandarin.

The tofu in the soup that they make here is super smooth, silky, and not too firm. There are various levels of spiciness that you can choose from. I typically have a very low to medium spice tolerance so I would say mild is just right.

The flavour really kicks at first near the beginning of your meal but after about 15 minutes once the soup cools down you will no longer taste the spiciness as much. The soup is also served with purple rice which is great. I feel warm each time eating here and it's a great place to come during these cold winter months. The seats can be a bit crammed, but nonetheless cozy

Their meals come with side dishes as well which include kimchi, maple dunked potatoes, sweet beans that are hard, and pickled vegetabies.

The bulgogi beef rice set is good as well but I still admire the tofu much more

Having been raised in Japan, I grew up eating something similar but under a different name. It is called temakizushi (手巻き寿司), a Japanese customized hand-roll. In my opinion, sushi burrito is just more creative name for a customized hand-roll. 

SERVICE
Their ""assembly line"" was disorganized and inefficient. I understand they just opened last week but I saw one guy grabbing something over another guy's arm. Then a new hire looking through recipe getting in the way of another guy. They should take some notes from Subway and learn to run the line smoothly. 3 people in front of me and I waited over 20 mins to order. Meh.

FOOD
I ordered Mission ($8.95) which comes with salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine lettuce, yuzu guacamole and tomatillo shiso sauce. Took out the pico de gallo since I can't handle any heat. 

There's definitely some texture, but it had absolutely no flavor. Tortilla strips gave some nice crunch and I liked how they are generous with salmon and ebi. However, even with their yuzu guacamole and tomatillo shiso sauce, a quick dip in soy sauce was necessary. Odd that I only tasted yuzu guacamole on one half of my sushi burrito. Put more sauce please. 

You can totally customize your own in bowl, burrito or nachos. Choose your toppings, protein and sauces. Will try this next time.

The employees have a complete lack of integrity, and are willing to lie about your service needs in order to make easy money. I was recently driving from Texas to Los Angeles for a new job, when my 2 year old Nissan Sentra shut off in a tunnel in Phoenix during the middle of rush hour traffic and 115 degree heat. Of course, this is very stressful, especially in the middle of a cross-country move. I was able to restart my car on the side of the road and get to ABC Nissan nearby just before they closed. After some rude service, the employee I was working with came back with news that my alternator had gone out. Additionally, he claimed no one in the state of Arizona had the part for my car, so I would be stuck in Phoenix for 5-10 days while they ordered the part, and would likely cost $800-900 in service. Fortunately, my cousin manages a Nissan dealership in Fresno, CA and a conversation with him made it clear that this was likely a scam trying to take advantage of my situation traveling and preying on me for easy money. Though not easy, I was able to find the part I needed at an O'reilleys auto store on the other side of town, and had my alternator tested by three different mechanics. Absolutely NOTHING was wrong with my car, confirmed by all three auto shops. My car ended up running fine all the way to Los Angeles the next day, and has been fine for over two weeks since this incident, which was likely a freak electrical issue in the heat after 13 hours of driving through the desert. ABC Nissan was not only trying to take a large amount of money from me for a non-existent issue, but also was willing to delay my travel and ability to start a new job in Los Angeles! Their willingness to literally screw me over on such a personal level, not just financially, is still shocking to me, as the problem with my alternator or the supposed lack of parts was completely false.

I will not hold the location of this place against it. But really it's not an area I'd go out of way to stay at under different circumstances. The traffic getting over there near the Liberty bridge is a B on a normal day. 

While I'll give them a break on location, there are other things that just don't work. One elevator. One. For a busy hotel, having only one elevator just makes no sense to me. Also, breakfast is a total cluster. So many people, not enough tables, not enough food. They ran out of simple things really quickly. Like ketchup and coffee.

And the thing that makes this place difficult for me to want to return to? The Internet is probably one of the worst of any place I've stayed to date. It's great to have it but only if it actually works. It dropped out constantly and you could load no pages when in use. 

We're the rooms nice and the decor overall lovely? Yes, it's actually a very nice suite setup, but the little annoying things were hard to let go. I can tolerate a lot if the Internet is decent. I know it's terrible to base so much on that, but we all know the stakes here.  

This hotel should seem far promising than it actually turns out to be. It just seemed to miss the mark in too many ways in my opinion.",3,0,0

It has taken me from NYC to L.A. and back. I had over 150,000 miles on it and by the time my baby started to break down I looked for a place I could trust to take care of it. The first thing I needed was my breaks done, once I had them replaced I noticed everything else started to break down almost all at the same time. The started wouldn't turn over (I needed a new started), my clutch chain broke, the water pump broke, which by the way he told me was replaced with a brand new water pump but their own mechanic who worked on my truck said that it was a refurbished one. And lastly (apparently) my block was cracked and I didn't know it. They wanted to charge me over $2,000 to replace the blcok. Their own tow guy recommended a different garage to take it to which was on the other side of the city to see what they could do. After taking it there and spending only $250 to repair the engine my truck hasn't had ANY problems. 

It just seemed like EVERY single time I took it in for each seperate issue it cost me close to if not over $1,000. They took me for over $5,000 for a truck that wasn't worth $2,000. Unfortunately I was too trusting thinking a credited corporate garage wouldn't take advantage of their clients and treat them with honesty & integrity. NOT, and that it a huge NOT!

It's too bad that certain mechanics (or managers of garages) like to take advantage of people and think it's okay because it's business.",5,0,0

The drink selection is vast. Serving sizes are perfect. The biggest problem I have with this place is the atmosphere--granted I hated the atmosphere at Marcelita's too. One of the rooms had the brightest lights I've ever seen in a bar\/ restaurant. The room we sat in was basically a sun room\/ porch, which for a table of adults on a Friday night is not great--and there were plenty of other open tables scattered around better parts of the restaurant. The food was just OK--doesn't compare to Mabel's on E. 4th. Brisket was decent--not too flavorful. The sausage links were dry. The onion rings were watery and had zero flavor. The mac and cheese is amazing. The plus side to all of this--I had 1 mixed drink and 2 craft beers plus an entire meal and my bill wasn't even over $50. I don't think I'll go rushing back to this restaurant unless it's to sit at the bar, which seems to be the highlight of the restaurant, and order appetizers. All in all--OK at best.

Upon arriving here, I liked that there was no issue with finding parking spots despite how busy this restaurant got for 1:30 p.m. on a Tuesday. I also liked how it was a casual space with cafeteria style ordering, a bunch of tables that were mostly clean and it had a couch area for hanging out. 

We had a really hard time choosing what to get since there were so many great choices on the menu and I really wish I had room in my stomach to try everything. After talking to different staff members there who all enthusiastically gave us their input, we ended up getting the butter chicken loaded fries, the healthy-ish salad with tandoori chicken in it, samosa filled with lentils (forgot the official name for this) and the ras malai cheesecake samosa. Our order came out to about almost $24 with tax. 

The butter chicken loaded fries looked delicious, it was tasty overall and a good portion. I just wish it could have stayed warm longer as I found that it was cold within less than ten minutes of eating it. There were some good flavours in the healthy-ish salad that we got with tandoori chicken but some of the chicken pieces I ate were slightly over seasoned. The samosa filled with lentils was flavourful, filling and the shell was crispy. Last, the ras malai cheesecake samosa was delicious and not too sweet - for me, this one was the clear winner of the bunch! 

In terms of portions, we were more than full enough with what we ordered. By the time we were done eating, there was just under half of the butter chicken loaded fries left and we still had about one third of the salad left. It was all filling considering how hungry we were at the start of the meal. 

All in all, we had a good dining experience here and I would definitely consider coming back to try some of their other menu items.",1,0,0

Wir wollten eigentlich nur den schönen Ausblick genießen und was trinken u eventuell auch was essen. Daraufhin, entschied sich der Ober eine Kehrtwendung zu machen, uns stehen zu lassen und er müsse erst mal fragen ob unser Tisch noch frei wäre.

I had the pulled chicken sammy, mac and cheese, hush puppies and maple baked beans. Chicken was a little tough and the coleslaw needed a little more acid but the mayo on the side was delish. Mac and cheese could use a little more sharpness but enjoyable. Beans were aces, and hush puppies were nice and moist. I sampled from my dining companions so got to try a bunch of menu items. Chicken fried steak was yummy. Hot Nashville chicken sammy was crunchy and doused in Frank's Red Hot, which is all right by me, but the friend who ordered it didn't like that the slaw was right on the sandwich - made the slaw hot, which defeats the purpose of the cooling slaw. Yams were sweet and sticky, and she enjoyed the mashed. Chicken wings were enormous and looked crispy. Didn't try. Burger looked dry. Ditto. Watermelon salad was lovely. Devilled eggs were disappointingly bland. Food took quite a while to come and it wasn't that busy but it had just opened for the day.

The space? Stunning. Deceptively low-key from the street, it's a work of art in and of itself. Wood-nymph themed, The entire counter looks like a tree trunk was ripped out of the English countryside and given a satin gloss finish. It's a stunner. The exposed mechanics lamps that make up the lighting in the space lend it an uber-cool industrial chic contrast.  The back wall is a screen with black and white films  being projected non stop. It was the 3 Stooges when we went. 

The owners use the Stumptown coffee beans from Portland, Oregon. Stumptown's prerequisite is that they must visit each location and properly instruct the baristas how to pull the shots. This ensures the beans get the proper flavour profile the roaster intended. Thus, the only wrinkle for me.

I wasn't a huge fan. I'll be back to do a followup but the shot was INSANE! Dark, short and super intense. It must be my mellowing out after the hip replacement but I find myself preferring a more balanced shot and a lighter roast these days. Unfortunately, all I could think of was the scene in Mulholland Drive

When I read that they are related to Sabai Sabai (my favorite Thai place in Toronto), I was here for my next meal.  I even dragged my team members with me.  In case you were wondering about the name, Sukhothai was the capital of the first Kingdom of Siam in the 13th and 14th centuries.  It also means ""the dawn of happiness"". 

The restaurant was nicely decorated and was inviting.  We were seated in a comfortable half booth table.  As I looked over the menu, I could see the similarities between here and Sabai (e.g. shrimp chips and tamarind dip and the khao soi).  Their most popular dishes are the Pad Thai and the Khao Soi.  In addition to their regular menu, they offer a lunch menu including everyday specials and daily curry specials.  The price range on the lunch menu is $9-$14.

Sukho Chicken Pad Thai - $13 - I asked the waiter what the differences were between this and the regular pad Thai.  He said the Sukho one comes with peanuts, herbs and lemon.  I guess it's like paying an extra $1 for condiments.  The portion was quite large, but that was the only thing I was impressed with.  It had good flavoring and I like the bits of tofu in it.  What ruined it for me were the soggy noodles that were sticking together.  Could it have been the lemon that did that?

Thai Iced Tea - $4 - This is the bright orange kind.  Pretty good, large sized glass, but pricey.

Although my first experience here didn't win me over, I would definitely come back to try some of their other dishes.",5,2,2

What I do fault them for is the atmosphere.  Namely, the proximity of every table to the other tables.  I've always noticed the dinning room is crowded, and the tables and chairs are wobbly.  In the past, my stepmother has even asked for different chairs.

Last time we went there (prob three years ago) my husband and I were seated upstairs, at a table between two other tables which were abutting the walls.  There was not more than 8 inches between our table and the one on either side of us.  A waiter had to squeeze through several times to get to the tables close to the window before we were even waited on.  That was enough for me.  We left., which I felt awful about, but it was just ridiculous.  Better for them to have left that table out that we were sitting at than to leave it there for the extra revenue.

You enter by going up a long farm lane, passing between several buildings, an event lawn, a group doing yoga on the other lawn, etc. It is very picturesque and seems like a good place for a wedding or other party. There are several buildings at the end of the lane and Morning Glory Cafe occupies the patio of one of those buildings - you duck beneath a vine-covered arbor and enter the seating area. The tables are patio tables covered with plastic red gingham patterned tablecloths with menus scattered on them. You choose your own table and are advised to help yourself to coffee, iced tea, lemonade, water at the station next to the house. You can also order a few other beverages from your server - orange juice, mimosas, bloody marys, etc. 

The menu is relatively brief but chock full of farm fresh ingredients. They have some interesting items - The Cowboy Breakfast Chili and Eggs, The Farm Monte Cristo, and the Chicken Enchiladas were all pretty unique breakfast fare and so we ordered one of each :) Browsing the menu, I learned that if you are a pancake\/waffle\/french toast\/pastry lover, this is not the place for you. The food came out REALLY fast, which makes me think that they have most of the stuff ready to go in the kitchen and just garnish\/sauce the dishes before sending them out. Itwas pretty good - I got the Chicken Enchiladas, which were filled with shredded chicken, covered with green chile sauce, and topped with Over Easy eggs. The temperature of the dish was less than great (a bit cold) and the yolks of my eggs were overdone, cooked all the way through. When I've had dishes like this before, the intention is that the yolks are runny and add moisture and flavor to the dish beneath. Since the eggs were overcooked, this didn't happen and it left the rest of the dish pretty dry (most of the green chile sauce was soaked into the enchiladas beneath) I did ask for extra chile sauce which was provided promptly, however it was very cold and did not spread well over the dish (I also could have still used even more of it, as the dish was SO dry) 

We had a side of bacon that was delicious, and my husband enjoyed the Cowboy Breakfast Chili. 

The setting was nice - we could hear roosters crowing and watch the activities of the farm\/preparation for the day's events, etc. while we ate.

Service was decent - the girl who was our server was nice but a little brief - I was having trouble deciding and asked her for her favorite item on the menu. She said the Chicken Enchiladas but didn't really elaborate further, which didn't sell me on it. Her demeanor just came across as pretty uninterested.

I felt like the prices were quite high considering the type of place (outdoor picnic tables), service (serve yourself for the key stuff and overall a little less than friendly) and food (seemingly mass made, okay tasting, not quite right) We spent $60 for three people and I walked away just really feeling as though it wasn't worth $20 per person.

Bakery, large seafood selection, large produce area I can't wait to come back to try out more items and have to try out the deli too for some take-out.  

I can't even tell you how excited the kids were checking out the live lobsters, crab  and catfish and the entire frozen selection on ice-very entertaining-best part was there was no big junk food aisle or toys or videos to distract them, just a grocery store!  Wow, what a concept!",8,2,3

As it was our first experience, we didn't come super early and had to wait in line for a while -- but didn't miss too much of the movie. 

I am docking a star only because I think the mechanics of the entryway could be a little better - our line only had one attendant for two windows (both sides of a ticket booth) and while she did a great job, perhaps things would go faster if there were two attendants\/registers in the booth.

I was told I was getting and paying for a product (OPI shellac) which the salon doesn't even carry. Funny enough there is a poster on their wall which advertises OPI shellac manicures $30.

I guess they didn't think I'd notice or that once they started the process I would let them continue. I almost did but then thought no! The technician specifically showed me samples of what she said were OPI shellac colours and OPI is the only shellac that stays on my nails so why would I pay for something else. 

To top it off, the owner had the audacity to say to me 'you're CANADIAN you shouldn't get upset'. Normally I don't but they were out of line, I don't take kindly to people lying to me or trying to manipulate me then tell me that it was a misunderstanding.

Anyway, the first time you go plan on being there at LEAST 4 hours. Eat something a few hours before you go, then again, literally JUST BEFORE you go!

You'll be waiting a while before they prick you to check your levels, so you'll stabilize, but won't be starving by the time they start pulling your fluids out.

The process is relatively painless. The waiting area feels more like a county hospital, but they did have movies playing. They CLAIM to have free wifi, and though I could connect, it wasn't getting me onto the 'net.

If you go, get all your calling and voicemails done before you go back to get sucked; no phone use! (They kind of look the other way for texting, but if it's up to your head, you'll get talked to)

Also, drink LOTS OF WATER before you go; you'll need to be well hydrated, as it will increase your chances of passing the screening, and will speed up the actual delivery of plasma. Plus, you have to pee in a cup.

After ogling other people's plates, everything looked very fresh and tasty.

I have a lot of great memories here at the Roosevelt, met a lot of wonderful people and friends who have been a big part of my life whether it is just grabbing a beer at the bar or taking over the huge community table or chilling at the candle lit booth section.

A few months back, a couple of ladies and I decided to stop by the Roosevelt while in Phoenix. It had been a long day of bike riding and the bar wasn't very busy (a big plus if you have been here on First Fridays!) so was excited to have a drink after enjoying our meal at Cibo.

A lot of sofas and chairs didn't have enough space for 4 people to sit with each other (you know that phenomenon when you go the movie theater and every row has seats but it would take an act of God to convince everyone to move a couple for everyone to sit together?) so we went for the high table in the middle dining room. It was missing a chair (and I have had the ""bitch seat"" in the past where I end up standing) but I was really tired after more than 20 miles of hard core bicycling and a relaxing carb-filled dinner. I went to take a seat from the bar but the waitress said we couldn't do that. I was taken aback since the bar wasn't busy and our table was missing the 4th chair.

She stated simply it was the policy and the manager doesn't allow chair moving. She didn't voice a solution. Then I looked over and saw the chair that should've been at our table was at the one with the booths against the wall. ""But clearly she took the chair from our table, and that chair is unoccupied and it isn't busy, so why not?"" What happened next was pretty....off putting. She said ""You want me to ask her to give you her chair back?"" Really.

Yes. What? Am I in 8th grade?  #1, that isn't what I said. #2, are you really arguing with 4 thirsty customers about a chair? 

We looked at each other and left. We had a great time at the Lost Leaf and we could move chairs where ever the hell we want.

She wasn't apologetic and even if it is the manager's policy, he isn't there. Did she think we were manager chair narcs?

You could have been mine ""4 LYFE"" Roosevelt as I stated when you first opened, but given your disdain for hospitality and respect for your customers, I see no need to go back. Enjoy that empty chair.",24,18,12

I found this company on yelp, as we were in need of a new pest service to help keep the scorpions in our area at bay. Since they had such good reviews, I checked out their website. I liked what I saw, so I filled out their form to get contacted for an estimate. I received an email back from Jaime a few days later, and they gave me a price quote. I asked if they could come out to do an estimate, so I could get a better idea of what they could do to help me pest issue, and get a more accurate pricing. The response I received was along the lines of they don't come out for estimates, making me feel as they are a one price fits all company, which goes against their supposed ""custom service"" for their customers. When I inquired about the high quote as I have done my research and have received estimates from other local companies, and have used some local companies in the past, I was told they are priced competitively and ""go look on yelp on how great we are"". The end. Well, no you are actually almost double what most companies are around the valley when they ACTUALLY CAME OUT TO GIVE A PERSONAL ESTIMATE. If your service works that well that customers are willing to pay that then great. However, you really aren't giving me the chance to find that out, as the only way I could get them to come out here was to hire them sight unseen. I felt as if my business was not important to them, and they could care less about my concerns.

There were 2 things about this location in particular though that kept me from giving them 5 stars:

1) Champagne is $10 a glass. It's complimentary at my normal location in Texas, so that was a bummer. 

2) Because the shop is in a mall, people walking by will sometimes stop and stare as you are getting your hair done. Feeling like a zoo animal takes away from the relaxing element of the experience a bit. 

We arrived nearly half an hour early for our appointment so I fully expected to have to wait, but was pleasantly surprised when they said they could take us straight away. 

We had tickets to see David Copperfield that evening, so I thought it would be fun to surprise my friend with blowouts so that we could glam up for the show. They washed our hair quickly and got us set up at our stations.

They always have chick flicks playing on mute (with subtitles) and that day it was the Notebook (which I only half paid attention to since it makes me ugly cry). They also had a live DJ who was spinning all my favs including everything from Michael Jackson to current pop hits. Another unique feature is their full bar and cocktail menu which most other locations don't have. I kept it simple and stuck with bubbles, but liked having multiple options. 

I got big loose curls while my friend bumped up the volume with their Southern Comfort. We both looked great and had awesome friendly stylists. The total bill came to $160 including two blowouts at $49 each, one glass of bubbly, and a $10 scalp massage my friend added on in addition to tips for both stylists. 

We had a blast, and our styles held up pretty well the rest of the evening. They do their best to hairspray you for staying power, but needing a few touchups will probably happen and is normal.",26,18,24

Knowing that it's situated in a neighborhood close to Mayfield and ETON plaza, I had a feeling that it'd be on the pricey end so I figure the place would be worth it but nope, I was wrong. Inside the place looks nice but that don't let it fool you. The prices were unreasonable and the food tasted mediocre. Having to pay close to $13 for a bowl of pho, there are better places to get this at than here. I ordered their vermicelli with shrimp and pork which i believe was #28, don't remember how much it cost but there were plenty of vegetables than the meats itself. To me, that's kind of a ripoff. Being Asian and tasting so many other pho dishes from a variety of places, this place is just plain. 

I've experienced it better somewhere else and seeing that the owner looks familiar to Pho #1 in Asia town gives me the feeling that it's just another chain of theirs. I wouldn't go back. After paying our bill, the waiter short changed us so that was another downfall.",6,2,0

It has a good beer garden, this is great for those 3.5 sunny\/warm days that happen in the summer.  
It has (from distant memory) totally reasonable pub food.  It will fill your belly with stodge to soak up the beer.
It shows major sporting matches (or at least, it showed the tennis when Andy Murray was playing last year).  This isn't a draw for me, but likely is for some.
... Ok I can't think of any other good points.

The bad...
It's pretty off the beaten track.  If you want to go anywhere else before or after the Ettrick, be prepared for the longest walk between pubs in all of Scotland (and by that I mean, like, 15 minutes).  
It doesn't have the best transport links, so see point above re: how long it will take to get to a reasonable bus stop.
It's FULL OF REALLY OLD MEN.

I don't have a problem with old man pubs but this takes it further than I think I'm willint to go.  I'm 29 and I'm pretty sure I was the youngest person there.  Ok yes I'm a child, but probably about 30% of the clientele were in the 70-100 range, 60% were in the 40-70 range, and 10% in the 29-40 range.  
I'm not even kidding.

The older homey decor and ambiance meant nothing to us - the food and service was on point! 

I can't be happier with their pad thai dish, flavor country for sure! The pad thai noodles were crazy moist and packed with flavor, we enjoyed every bite. The noodles were cooked to perfection, not overcooked and with a little bite to them. They were just perfect! 10 stars for the pad thai (Yup it's over 5 stars)

We also ordered panang beef curry - this was the first place that didn't pack the curry with a bunch of cheap fillers. They hooked us up with a ton of tender beef - a mountain of tender beef to be exact. That's a great value and we didn't feel cheated. A minor flaw - I felt that the dish could of benefited from having more curry for the beef ratio that we got. Anyways, I can't really complain since there was a ton of beef!

The service was amazing as well! I'm extremely satisfied with their waitress and their management. The waitress hand cut our thai bird chilies in fish sauce for us because we requested them and they didn't have any available in their spice tray. We love the fact that the owner was there (late night 10:30pm on a Sunday) overseeing things and chopping it up and playing cards with his regulars. It really shows his dedication to his restaurant and it comes through in his food. Really good people. 

Their spice levels are from 1-5. Their spicy #3 was an exact spicy #3. True to flavor. We are spice junkies and could of done a #5 and enjoyed it, but we dabbled in the spice tray a lot and it worked out well for us. 

Portion wise, the pad thai was a great size for one person to get their fill on the juicy good stuff. It's not family sized and not necessarily big enough to share, but that just means more of the good stuff to yourself!

However, this Friendly's was absolutely filthy when we came in.

Now had we been in during a peak dining time (or perhaps immediately after) I would've understood a less-than clean restaurant, but we came in around 3pm and there was only 1 other table occupied.  It looked as if an entire kindergarten class had a field day in there with no adult supervision.  There were french fries and gummi bears strewn across the floor, dirty napkins and plates still on tables (they were still there when we left), crumbled crayons everywhere...it was a mess.  To top it off, not a single staff member was actively cleaning the entire time we were there and I saw at least 5 people working at the time.  Makes me wonder what kind of state the kitchen is in...

Please do not allow this wicked company to steal your hard-earned money any further. On July 9th, 2012, I was almost killed at this establishment.

The lighting is a bit darker and adds a romantic feel which I didn't mind being that I was on a date. 

Vapiano has adopted a different style of service with bar stations depending upon the type of food you want: pizza, pasta, salad, etc. We decided on the pizza station, and the specialty pizza which featured capers, sun-dried tomatoes, Italian sausage, and black and green olives. Pizza only comes in one size but it was still plenty of food. 

The service here was great although it is basically self serve at the bar stations. You order, then take a pager and sit down; once your food is ready they place it on top of the bar and you place the beeper inside the basket. It was quite a seamless process and the food was ready in no time. The food was excellent, but I was even more impressed by the layout and design of the restaurant.

Ordered corned beef hash and French toast. French toast was fairly standard, although the cinnamon butter on top was delicious. Corned beef hash was slices of beef, peppers and onions on top of home fries.

Billy Kun is my favorite Day Bar. In my humble opinion at night, it's a fracking disaster: Music is too loud, it is jammed pack. The place kind of have a Pool smell because of the Javex or something and when packed with people, It doesn't feel like it's ok. Thing you must know about the decor is the stylish Oestrich head on the wall + the little Hexagonal tuiles that makes the place kind of look like a public pool. In the Men's room there's a pool isle with reversed numbers AND THE FASTEST HANDRYER IN THE WORLD! 12 seconds! (that what is says on the machin). The staff is friendly and they look like they enjoye their working environment. If you haven't been in Prague, well my first advice would be GO!! IT's a Walt Disney for the  Adult MAle: Cheap beer, beautiful Women, amazing architecture.... Until you go, Billy kun offers that famouse Budwar. The beer that had the name Budweiser and got into this multi-millions trial on who owned the name on the Market Place: Praha BRewery (which I don't know the name) or the American one. Needless to say who won! Unfortunatly the worst one in taste won! Not kidding the Budwar (AKA Czechwar in North America) is a SOLID Czech Lagger


Billy Kun c'est mon bar de jour favori. A mon humble opinion, l'expéricience du bar le soir est désagréable: La musique est trop forte, l'éclairage trop sombre et  la place est occupée! Il y a une odeur de piscine dans la place, un peu chloré à cause du plancher en tuile surement lavé au Javex. Le problème c'est que de jour, on comprend que ça fait propre et c'est bizarre a expliquer mais ça fait parti du décor. Au toilette des hommes, il y a même quelque couloirs de natation en face des urinoir avec les numéros écrit à l'envers. Il y a aussi LE SÈCHE-MAIN LE PLUS RAPIDE AU MONDE! 12 secondes! Oui Madame!!! Rien de moins!Quand c'est plein, le mixte d'odeur des gens, la pesenteur de l'air chlorisé devient pu aussi intéressant et tout d'un coup, un peu moins concept!  Le personnel est courtois sans être coinçé où trop personnel. Il y a les habitués du jour, la musique est souvent sympa et y'a un peu de jazz live desfois.

Billy Kun sert une bière Tchèque et un genre de Jaggermeister Tchèque qui s'appelle le Beroveska ou un truc du genre. Mon avis la-dessus: C'est pas buvable! Mais plusieurs adore et les Slovaques et Tcheque eux en boivent en masse. On y vend aussi de la Czechwar, la meilleure Lagger commerciale que j'ai vu dans ma vie. La Czechwar est la Budwar en Europe et c'était anciennement Budweiser avant qu'un méga-procès de plusieurs millions de dollars aille lieux sur les droits d'exploitation de Budweiser. En fait, légalement parlant les américains ont gagné même si 1: celle tchèque est hautement supérieur 2: Ce sont les tchèque qui ont commencé a utilisé le nom!  Enfin!

First off, as others have pointed out, this place used to be a Omelete House. A lot of the menu items still reflects this fact with the same type of expansive omelet selection and even how they do their potatoes.

I played it safe and got the sweet cream pancakes, spuds, eggs, bacon, and patty sausage. The pancakes were so flat and tough, they had the sweet cream flavor, but other than that they weren't that good. Only two pieces of bacon came with the pancakes,  they were fairly small and limp. The patty sausage was the kind you would get out of McDonalds, pretty disappointing for a supposed family diner. The spuds were just like the kind you would get out of Omelet House. I asked for them to be extra crispy and with extra seasoning. They came crispy but without the extra seasoning. I asked for the eggs to be scrambled soft.  They ended up being the best thing of my meal, they were fluffy and juicy.

The service was decent. I got the extra napkins I asked for, but I ended up waiting a bit for my check and I just ended up having to walk up to the register to settle my bill.

- The soup was watery, no flavour like it wasn't cooked long enough

- Parts of the lobster were under cooked
- Veggie was soggy and over-cooked
- Clams were flavourless as they were just boiled
- Stir-fried eel was just not good

I had the eggs, hash browns, bacon and English muffin.  The bacon was pretty good although it could have been cooked for just a couple minutes longer.  The hash browns for the most part were mushy and didn't really have cooked edges.  The eggs were....strange?  I've never had scrambled eggs that tasted like that.  I can't explain it, they tasted almost fake?  Like they were powdered and came from a box or something.  I couldn't finish them they just tasted off.  Kind of unfortunate for a place called the US Egg.  The English muffin was by far my favorite part so that's saying something.

Then they hooked her up with a birthday crown and cake!! The painting instructions were relatively easy to follow. It went a little fast, but really everyone has their own painting pace. And there were always moments where we could ask for help from the instructor as she walked around to see how we were doing. 
The food tastes really good. The portions are okay. But I'm not gonna give 4 b\/c of that. That's silly. Free refills of sodas though!! I had 2 hehe.
All in all, it was a really fun time. Got to sit and commune with the random strangers around me! It was a really nice atmosphere and everyone, stranger, server, and teacher alike were so kind and sweet. Needless to say, but I shall continue with it anyway, my mom had an absolutely wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed her birthday present. (I enjoyed it lots too!!)
Got to keep our paintings too  

Some Tips:

Food is expensive - trying to save? Eat before you come and just snack or drink soda\/beer (free soda refills!!) | Not trying to save? Chow down! The food is amazing. Small proportions for the price doe.

Bring a seat cushion - the seats aren't all too comfortable. Especially if you don't have a lot of meat on your bones

You are going to get paint on you are your hands. They supply aprons, but wear expendable clothes. 

Be patient. You're not gonna like your painting right away. Remember, you're not an artist (or maybe you are). In either case, take a deep breath and just keep at it, but don't freak out. It'll turn out nicely. Still think it sucks? Ask for help or for another's opinion. The littlest change can make the biggest difference. 

The S Durango location allows 13+ children\/teens\/young adults

Check in on Yelp!! - great savings to be had

Change your water every now and then once in class

uOiMVymosu6S3NOlD7Gv3A,hsu9lyXiAX5dQD4lLzYyyA,aiSfc14ci0YqzIiZ6CEXIQ,4,2015-01-19,"Back to the future is 30 years old now, back to the past has been around since the 50's in the Kannapolis area at the What-A-Burger Drive-Ins, several of which still exist around this part of the state. 

There have been several chains that have had a version of the name What-A-Burger - one around the Virginia Beach area, another one in Texas in the same time frame, the 50's (and by far the largest, throughout the SE), and this one in the Concord\/Kannapolis area, started by the Bost family, with the first one opening in 1956.

C. W. Bost was selling hamburgers at a local diner in Concord in 1955, and supposedly visited a McDonald's out west and was inspired to try the concept on a local level. The next year he opened the first What-A-Burger in Concord, and business took off. There may have been as many as 15 locations (not all at the same time) in a 4 or 5 county area, and may be one or two slipped across the state line in to SC, opinion vary on this. This location was opened in December, 1964.

At one point, the restaurants were assigned a number (this one is #10, and still says so on the sign, as does #11 in Mooresville), and not necessarily in the order they were opened. There are 6 or 7 left now of that original chain, most in Cabarrus County, and the one in Mooresville. There is a restaurant in Whitesville that uses the name, and is ""famous"" for its breaded French Fries, but is not connected to this chain. And there is a  little hamburger joint in Greensboro, Church Street Drive-Inn, that has been serving a What-A-Burger since 1959, and in the same spot since 1965, but has no connection to the chain.

This place still offers full drive-in service, and the food is excellent - true drive-in style burgers, hot dogs, onion rings, fries, and even a solid Pork BBQ Sandwich. The thing about What-A-Burger has always been about the size of the burger - it is big, a 6 ounce patty on a large bun, and it is an excellent diner style burger, full of flavor. 

The Hot Dog is equally good, loaded with tasty chili, a decent wiener, and a soft bun. This is an excellent place to get your dog all-the-way because their slaw is great, very creamy. The BBQ Sandwich really surprised me, I did not remember it as being all that good, but this is not bad pig, at all. 

They are known for 2 drinks here - Cherry Lemon Sun Drop and their Witch Doctor Drink - a mixture of various soft drinks to which several dill pickle slices are added - this is an acquired taste, obviously, The pricing has always been reasonable - the Cheeseburger, BBQ Sandwich, Hot Dog, and 2 large drinks were just over $12.

This is truly a blast from the past place, with the added bonus of serving great drive-in food at a very nice price. It is worth the trip.",5,0,1

Around the restaurant various reviews\/awards are posted and I can understand why but it's purely based on specific menu items (like their coconut cream pie).

Primarily my pet peeve with this place was it smelled like a washroom that hadn't been cleaned in a while. This is not something you want to smell when you're eating! The meal that I had was average, if not disappointing. Their potatoes were spicy, the coffee was too strong but their scrambled eggs were perfect.

At the end of the meal, I decided to try the award, winning coconut cream pie which was delicious! Made in house, the large, fluffy slice made me almost forget about the rest of the meal.

I had no idea what to expect since I had not been on a scooter before. I didn't think it would go as well for me but I was up for it! Justin came to pick me up right in front of my hotel. I was his first pick-up. Then he picked up about 9 other people at various hotels that would join me on the tour of Red Rock Canyon. Justin was so engaging on the shuttle ride there. He took time to get to know each and every individual in the shuttle. I went by myself since my friend was busy with a conference. I didn't feel out of place or alone at all! The drive there was absolutely beautiful. Justin was very knowledgeable about Vegas and some of the sites on the ride there. Once we arrived, we each picked out a helmet (I chose a white one with a visor) and we walked over to choose a scooter. I forgot my shades in the hotel so they provided that as well. They think of everything!!! They even have spare jackets for people who need one (I didn't forget mine). 

After we choose a scooter, Justin went over a few things about the tour and the scooters. He had us do a couple of drills to get a feel for the scooter's speed and brake sensitivity. This was very important to me because I was so nervous about riding the scooter. It was a rocky start for me at first but before I knew it, I was a pro! Listen to everything they say because they are so right! You turn the scooter with your eyes! Listen to that and you won't be sorry. Your body naturally turns for you so be sure to relax and you'll be fine. Justin and Josh were so amazing and encouraging. I never once felt unsafe. When we were all comfortable with riding the scooters, we started the trip. Justin stayed in front of us (we were all in a single file line) and Josh stayed behind us to make sure we were all accounted for during the tour. We stopped along the way for a nature tour and to take in the beauty of the place. The weather was absolutely perfect. Everything about this tour was perfect. It was so serene and gorgeous. I was stressed and down about a few things back home but this tour allowed me to reflect on things and realize how minor they were. There was something about the wind in my hair and the serenity of the location that really made me feel alive! The tour reminds you of how beautiful life is. I was absolutely happy. It sounds dramatic but it's so true. You forget about all of your worries out there.

This was by far the most unexpected and best part of Vegas for me. It's crazy to think that something so natural and beautiful is just 20 min outside of the strip. You absolutely HAVE to try this tour. Justin and Josh are so awesome! I have had some amazing life experiences and I have to say this is in the top 5. I didn't want it to end!

Here are a few tips:

1. Bring water - Justin provides this on the tour but you may be thirsty on your way there).
2. Bring a snack\/gum\/mints - this is about half a day's time so you may want something to nibble on.
3. Bring a jacket - It can get a little chilly in the shaded areas and while riding. my jacket also protected me from the sun because I forgot my sunblock.
4. BRING SUNBLOCK - I can't believe I forget this. I was lucky enough to have my jacket, the helmet, and the sunglasses to protect me. I didn't get sunburn.
5. Bring sunglasses! I forgot mine but they have some nice loaners they provide.
6. Bring a selfie stick if you have one. I don't own one but someone brought one and appeared to have captured some great shots! She was also brave enough to use it while riding the scooter. The selfie stick looks like it helped out a lot. 
7. Wear closed toe shoes.
8. If you're thinking about this and weighing the options... JUST DO IT. I promise you won't regret it.",1,0,0

Our server, Nicole, was such a great host! She took care of us quickly but still gave us enough space to feel like were not being rushed. 
We had the Bruschetta as an appetizer, which was delightful and so fresh. 
Our main courses were fantastic. I had the Angel hair pasta with shrimp, my girlfriend enjoyed her egg plant parmesan and to be honest I can't remember what her sister ordered but it was delicious as well. 
We ended the night with NY style cheesecake and it certainly hit the spot.

But I only do AM appointments and you don't have any for the next few weeks, do you have Saturdays? ""No, we do not"". So I had to figure out my schedule and then call them back some other time... Then I rec'd a call on the Wednesday following and the lady on the other line informs me that my son had an appointment this afternoon and wanted to know if he was going to still come in.

It's a local institution with awesome sandwiches and pop, right?  On this trip, I was able to fit it in - it was an experience that I don't need to experience again.   I hadn't looked at the reviews so I didn't realize that it was so limiting - essentially a meat and cheese on gigantic white bread with vinegar based coleslaw and fries.
I asked the server for a recommmendation and went with the pastrami and cheese - it was fine - a huge sandwhich and I was super hungry and was able to eat most of it but it's just not my thing.
Kudos to Primanti for knowing how to provide a big sandwich with just the right balance of toppings.  Only the coleslaw overflowed.
They go light on the cheese but it's a good thing.  You will be full after eating here and probably will not want to eat anything or look at food for a long while.

However, my experience last night made me NEVER want to dine in at this location ever again. The last time we ordered takeout from them, they told us they were out of tuna. How can you be out of tuna ?? Anyways, I gave them another shot and headed there on a Wednesday night when needing a close and quick place to eat.

Things started off ok. We ordered our drinks and app whch came out pretty quickly. Drinks were nice and strong and calamari is always delish there. And then we didn't see our server for over 40 minutes!!! My husband eventually had to walk to the bar himself in order to get our second drink. Not one person refilled our water glasses during that whole time. I asked two other servers if they could locate ours and she never showed. 

We noticed that the table next to ours had seemingly ordered the same rolls as us. No coincidence there -- the couple sent the food back....they had received our order mistakenly. Our server never mentioned this or explained the delay. SImply whisked their plate away and didn't return for another 25 minutes after taking it. When she did finally come to give us our food, I was very honest about the poor service and told her we were well aware she had messed up.

And I can see why so many fellow Pittsburgh Yelpers really do not like this place.

I showed up here because I had some time to kill before I headed to work and I wasn't in the mood for fast food.  When I entered I was hit by a noise wall that was extremely loud.  So loud that when it came to ordering I was basically shouting my order to the employee behind the register.

After ordering I proceeded to the pick up area and just waited, I'd rather do that when I am dining alone.  Once the order was placed on the counter and my name was called I became disappointed.  When I was yelling my order to the register girl I had said that I wanted the pick two combo, half tomato mozzarella Panini and mac n cheese.  When I picked up my plate what I got was my Panini and half a ham and cheese.  o_O  Mac n cheese does not equal ham and cheese.  And I ended up with a piece of baguette even though I said I did not want it.  Who wants that much bread on one plate?  The only thing I got right in this order was the lemonade.  I didn't even argue because I know that I wouldn't have been heard anyway.

When I got to the table, or should I said crumb top table, I was disgusted.  I really didn't even want to eat my food.  I know you are busy, but have one of the twenty or so employees prepping food come out and wipe down the tables that are recently emptied.  In fact, I really didn't eat my food, I more like picked at it.  One bite of the Panini and I was done, especially when I came across a nut that I'm pretty sure didn't belong in there.

Well the two stars is for the classical music they play and the nice people watching through the large windows and it's nice and bright. The meal was the classic breakfast. For those who like baby potatoes it's a dream. The eggs were so greasy I guess I can't complain because I hear it helps after a night of drinking gin. I asked for tomatoes instead of home fries which he majority of places doing including all small town places I've been but the lady gave me a hard side eye and a stiff lip and told the girl she should know they don't modify. Poor girl gave me a sad sympathetic look. It was me giving her the look later. The lady who is the owner everyone talks about was yelling at staff and talking about how she needs alcohol to get through her days. He pastries don't look all that special and they have pastries sitting uncovered next to the cash register which seems unsanitary and people coughing onto them.  Baguette with the breakfast was delicious and overly buttery which was fine by me. It seems like a great deal that you get lattes for $2 everyday compared to the almost $4 at pain perdu down the street. Also you must pay at cash register first then go pick your order up when she shouts your name. Remember CASH ONLY for payment and I have no idea where an ATM is.

The Vig, with several locations across the valley, is about atmosphere, American food, and cocktails. Fillmore maintains an ample space for your socializing needs in the form of one of the better patios in the valley. On the rare occasion it's below 80 degrees at night (It's September, I'm *so* over summer), I'm sure this would really shine.

I don't mind sitting out on warm nights, but I'm starting to realize how much of an impact that can make on drinks--while the cocktails appeal appetizing, almost all of them come to you diluted, a product of mixing with warmer products. This doesn't matter at all with basic items, but really messes up more complex refreshments. On paper, the Chim Chareu (Gin\/aloe\/watermelon\/cucumber) is the beverage of my dreams. In reality, it just tasted like cucumber water. Every time I've been here, the cocktails have been mediocre. A similar lack of detail is paid to the less pricey drinks. Yes, Tito's for $4 is choice! But you should probably order it straight-up. Both times I tried one with tonic, it was absolutely flat!  That's not very nice. :-( 

But for what it lacks in liquor, The Vig makes up with three groovy qualities: 

-Stellar happy hour bites

-More than fair craft beer prices

-Servers who are attentive and know how to stay organized while covering a large area.

I recently purchased an unlocked Samsung Galaxy S4 from them only to find that it was a completely fake phone. They mentioned in their Kijiji ad that it was AUTHENTIC and brand new. 

Signs that it was counterfeit:
-Battery looked used and was scratched, said the cell was made in China instead of Korea. Also had random Chinese characters on it
-Even though I was told it was brand new, the phone was not in original packaging\/sealed (the charger and other parts were brought from the back of the store)
-TMobile logo appeared after turning on the phone
-Phone was a dark blue colour. This colour is not offered by Samsung. After the incident, I purchased this phone from an official retailer and the staff told me it was never released in that colour
-The warranty lasted only three months which is strange for a new phone

I was also interested in purchasing a pair of Apple EarPods and they offered me ones with world flag designs. After researching online I found that these were never offered by Apple. ANOTHER fake product.

The shop associates were extremely unprofessional and rude. They were upset when I wanted to return my product and said I was wasting their time.

Coming from the west side I excitedly told them about the new Brazilian Steakhouse on P83 and after our great meal at Fogo we were looking forward to this.
To start with the bar service was terrible. We waited quite a while for our drinks. During this time a server said we could go to the salad bar...never explained the "" gaucho"" dining experience. The other guests had never been to a  Brazilian Steakhouse. Finally our server returned with our cocktails and explained the procedure.  The salad bar was just ok...beans and rice were awful. Marinated items were good...salads good. 
The true issue was the meat!! Except for two or three items...bottom sirloin, filet and bacon wrapped filet, meats were of poor quality. Tasteless( except for special of the house which was sos so salty)..stringy and tough. So so disappointing. Many were cold. Coffee service was nonexistent. Had to flag someone down to remove salad plates and provide fresh ones since the "" gauchos"" did not do this. Also had to flag someone down for the filet and lamb chops. David...the one server who truly was excellent...did his best. Looked like he was trying to pick up the slack all over...and with a dimpled smile!! Servers were rushed and inattententive...seemed overwhelmed.
Had to search for David( not our server) for dessert. Again...plates sat and sat at our table even though red tickets were all up.

My boyfriend & I rode our bikes here & first of all, we couldn't find anywhere to lock them up.. so after 10-15 minutes we found a tree\/pole type thing on this little hill to lock them up &after battling some thorns. But that wasn't the worst part. We walk in & its a super cute wooded area but were looking around for produce & products to graze. And there was literally like a box or two of tomatoes, lemons, cabbage, a few other things. Then there was a little cabin type thing of honeys, vinegars, and at one point it looks like they had butter? So maybe because we came at noon they sell out early in the morning? They close at 2.. so maybe people just know to come early? So after doing a 5 min walk around, we were like okay lets get a juice at this juice bar they have, but there was at least 15 people in line in front of us.. ugh. so we left after 10 minutes max. We spent more time locking up our bikes then we did at the Farm. So the only reason I can think to come here is to let your kids play and run around, or just to sit by the fire pit and relax? Other than that, I cant think of any reason to come here, ill stick to the Scottsdale or DT Phoenix farmers markets if I actually want to buy some stuff & have some sort of a selection.

UPDATE: just looked at reviews below & saw : **TIP:  If you want to get the best veggie selection from the Farmer's Market get there EARLY.  By the time we got there 10:30am lots of the veggies were gone.** -- wish I would have read this before I went. Nothing left around Noon.",6,4,2

I made our reservation about a month in advance and we had to wait about 5 minutes when we got there because the people at the table they had for us decided to order another bottle of wine. They ended up giving us a table downstairs.

I had told the restaurant over the phone that it was my boyfriends birthday and they said they would do some kind of dessert for it.

We decided to order some apps before the meal. We got the gnocchi and Roccos salad. Both very delicious!

For the main I got the duck confit pizza which had no sauce and pear on it. It was absolutely unreal. Probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had. My boyfriend got some spicy pepperoni pizza, it wasn't listed on the menu because it was the special of the day.

During the meal I got up to remind our waiter it was my boyfriends birthday and he said he would bring something over. 

After we finished the waiter came over with the dessert menu. I was hoping my boyfriend wouldn't order anything because we were gonna get something for free. He ended up ordering an espresso and a gelato, and I ordered a chocolate affogato.

The waiter ended up bringing a wooden plate that said happy birthday in nutella and had both our desserts on it. I figured since he picked a dessert off the menu it would not be included on the bill. Turns out it was and that's the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. I don't mind paying but if they said they would include something they should. Oh well!

Overall it was great. Good service, amazing food and a cool environment! Would definitely go back.",0,0,0

Parking is on the opposite side of the entrance.

Food is mediocre.
Portions are small.
Prices lean to the high side.
Menu is limited.

The good:
Nice decor.
Extremely clean.
Large staff.
Great craft beer selection.
Friendly waitresses.

I will give them more time to work things out and try again in the future.  When Doublewide Grill opened near the same time I didn't think the area could support two similar restaurants.

After I was finished, the manager, (female unknown name) came to pick up out plates.  I politely let her know that the burrito didn't have much meat in it so maybe she could mention it to the cook.  I wasn't asking for anything free.  I was even trying to tell her how much I enjoyed the burrito in the past.  But before I could even finish my sentence, she sternly replied that there is nothing she could do about it because I had already eaten the burrito (even though there was still a third of the tortilla filled with a cup of rice on my plate).

The food is prepared from the very best ingredients, with great care and superb culinary technique.  The room is very nice, but the interior is overshadowed by the fantastic 56th floor view, which I believe is the best view in Vegas.  Because the Palms is about a mile west of the Strip, rather than right on the Strip, it has a great panoramic view of all the Strip architecture and of the entire Las Vegas valley.  The service is first rate.  Presenting a seven course tasting menu without any delays is a challenge in itself, but the wait staff also managed to be very attentive and personable, answering all questions and giving a helpful explanation of each dish.

Each course offers three options, including a vegetarian option.  For my first course I chose the corn soup, which was very fresh and bursting with corn flavor.  They must have access to some fantastic corn, which showed up as an ingredient if several of the dishes.

My second course was the seared foie gras, which was not overly rich the way that foie gras sometimes is, and was supported by several sweet flavors including white chocolate and orange pain perdu (that's French toast to us Americans).  A very nice version of foie gras.

For the third course I opted for the scallops, and they were as good as any I have ever had.  The corn made an appearance again, as a puree, and the wild mushrooms were a nice note.

Fourth course was the roasted chicken breast.  I don't usually order chicken in restaurants; it is more of a cook-at-home dish for me.  But I'm glad that they had a poultry course, which really showcased how well chicken can play if properly cooked and paired with a variety of supporting flavors like ricotta-stuffed morel mushrooms.

The fifth course was the star - flat iron steak with fingerling potatoes and beef jus.  Perfectly cooked, tender and tasty.

The sixth course was a selection of cheeses, and if I only knew where I could buy them I would be serving those cheeses at home as a part of every dinner.  When you compare these cheeses to what is available at your local megamart, you will conclude that they should have a whole different name for this stuff.  Maybe ""ubercheese.""

Finally, desert.  I had the cheesecake, along with a bite of my wife's chocolate souffle, and both were excellent.  After that hearty meal I appreciated the fact that the cheesecake was small - just a few bites of heaven.  The coffee was quite good as well.

It seems that the tasting menu changes frequently, so there is no guarantee that any of the dishes described above will be available on the night you go to Alize, but I have great confidence in the chef, and you will likely find some excellent choices on your tasting menu.  One tip for saving a few bucks:  Our dinner, with drinks, wine, tax and tip included, would have come to about $500, but we saved a hundred bucks by purchasing a voucher from Travelzoo.",1,0,0

The basic problems with Skibo (like many CMU dining locations) are that they have a reasonably small set of ingredients, and that they cook with tons of grease.  Despite what appears to be a fairly varied menu, all of the sandwiches, subs, paninis, and so on are pretty similar (just in different shapes), and greasy.

The few reasonable items on their menu include the salads (the chicken and artichoke one is pretty good), the desserts (they're from Gullifty's, which manages Skibo and the Underground), and the frozen yogurt (which makes good shakes, but is cheaper by itself).

Having been stuck on the CMU meal plan for freshman year, I found the baked penne with basil sauce reasonable (although it is far from healthy), and ended up succumbing to the frozen yogurt far too often than I should have.  However, if you're not stuck on the meal plan, walk the couple blocks to Craig St., where you can find *much* better food for less money.",0,0,0

Listen if you know me, you know I'm a pain in the butt vegetarian who is super picky about what veggies I like, so after what took 10 minutes for the poor hostess to get down (think when Harry met Sally ordering style) not surprisingly our order was not correct but we had already walked a mile back to the room and in pjs. I called and explained the situation and Kellan offered to hand deliver the right order to our room even though they have no delivery so we wouldn't be put out anymore. We were so grateful since we had been on our feet all day and walking back to pick up our food was the last thing we wanted to do.  What an angel on earth. Oh and the veggies were perfect too.

For some reason the dentist never discussed what was needed to fix this problem but he did the repairs he was directed to do. Was told by office manager amount it took to put a final, removable bridge, so I took a one time loan for $2,692.00+  Told I needed to let my mouth heal so a temporary removal bridge was put in until June. In June I went in and was given a lot of papers by office manager because I became very concerned that they were asking for more money. In the paper work given me but never duscussed on June 1,2015, they wanted an additional $3,700. (The two added up to over $6,000. for a permanent  removal bridge, the cheaper of the two procedures)
Also, the office manager told me that they needed to clean my teeth. They ended up doing a deep cleaning and did not tell me that it would cost around $1000.  What was done was a one appoint  procedure.( Most deep cleaning is done in 4 sessions because of the amount of chemical to numbing gum around each tooth.)  Result was that my mouth was so numb I could not talk for hours and effected my ability to eat, etc. Waiting to get this matter to be resolved has resulted in the losing over 20 pounds trying to eat with this  temporary bridge.

Bf & I came here on a Tuesday around 5pm, and when we were seated we realized we were the only customers at the time. Our server was good for quickly bringing us water and menus, but she didn't think to come take our orders. Her male coworker (who looked to be the bartender) had to come and take our order. He wasn't as knowledgable when it came to the menu items, but he helped us to the best of his ability. As we waited for our meal, being the only table in the joint, our server completely neglected us. The bartender(?) came around and filled our water glasses for us. It took 25 mins for our nachos and a small app of ours to arrive, but my bulgogi didn't come until 40 mins after we ordered it... not impressed considering it was prime dinner time and we were the only table there... 
By the end of the meal, the ONLY encounter we had with our server was when she originally seated us\/brought us menus & water, brought us our food, and cleaned some tables nearby. The bartender was the one who took our orders, filled our water glasses and gave us the bill- he even checked if we were satisfied with the food. 
Wish the server spent less time talking to her friend at the bar and more time checking in on us and making sure our water glasses were filled instead of making her coworker do so...

Food quality and quantity 
We got the pulled pork nachos that was on special and they were fantastic! Both my bf and I were really impressed! He didn't like his waow bun that much but that's cuz it wasn't really his type of food. My bulgogi was pretty average, but not bad. It was a bit greasy and it probably could have had more meat chocked into it for $10... as they filled it with glass noodles even though the menu stated it would come with vermicelli noodles (thin rice noodles). 

Overall I don't think i'd come back unless it was for drinks, but definitely not for a sit down meal. Would order the nachos again but sadly they're only a Tuesday\/Wednesday special. Hope the owner sees this and does something about customers being neglected by the servers  considering I saw other reviews having similar issues.",1,0,1

After a bad experience on our first visit here the Food & Beverages manager invited us back to give them a 2nd chance to make things right..... The manager on duty ""David"" had been emailed to expect our arrival.

With a last name that is not ""Smith"" there was no acknowledgement of our expected arrival simply a ""last name?"" ""room number?"" And an almost I'm bored with my job ""this way..."" 

We were seated at a small table in the middle of the dining room at an adequately sized table for 2...

After confirming our arrival enquiring about the particulars of the ""Meal on us invitation"" there was still a lack of engagement. I mean not that I was expecting a red carpet and 20 wait staff. But nothing.... But a welcome back, if there's anything we can do.... Simply a ""Yes, I received an emailed that you'd be coming.

We ordered our meals and drinks...

James had a cauliflower soup starter, we didn't really get the olive oil swirl on top, other than looking cool it seemingly served no purpose. James had a couple of spoons, he didn't personally care for it, or finish the starter.

I had the Salt & Pepper Calamari with was tender and soft with a nice crispy light fried batter, artichoke, baby octopus, and peppers.

It would be better served with a couple of slices of lemon. The tangy calamari dip was ok, neither great nor bad, adequate.

Even though I enjoyed it, I did not finish the whole starter as I was eagerly awaiting our main meals. Ribeye steaks, one ordered well done, one ordered med well.

Our 2x Ribeye's arrived... 1 well done ribeye and one med rare NY Strip, yes a NY STRIP... Pointing out the clear difference to the waiter between the two cuts of meat, one rounded marbled  steak with fat throughout and mine the med rare fat strip like steak with no fat content other that to thick lining of fat running along one edge of the steak. Our waiter quickly disappeared into the kitchen. 

David the manager came out after a short time with waiter, arms folded, ready for battle, proclaiming that he spoke with the chef and the chef assured him that he cooked the same two cuts. In-spite of David standing at the table and able to see the VERY CLEAR DIFFERENCE  between the two cuts of meat, David sided with the chef...

Are we not looking at the same plates here right now!?
Are you seriously describing the differences between Ribeye's and NY Strips, describing perfectly the 2 different cuts of meat that were sitting in the two plates on the table in front of you and siding with the chef that stated he cooked the same 2 cuts?

Are you kidding me right now!? David just described what's on our plates.... Our two plates should look identical in every way other than the cook on the steak.

David dismissively asked me if I'd like my steak re-done.
No, I don't... especially not after you side with the chef and argued the differences yet what your describing is what's in front of you on our plates...

I'm not even hungry at this point, just in total disbelief...

David then proceeded to come out to the kitchen to show me the 2 prices of meat in their raw farm proudly pointing out the strip of fat along the side of the NY strip and the marbling throughout the Ribeye... AGAIN YES as was on my plate and James' plate, only in cooked form...

What are we arguing here? I'm absolutely freaking beside myself in awe... What are you arguing here? Other than proving that we got 2 different steaks when we were suppose to get the same.............

What manager brings out raw steak to the dining room to argue HIS POINT IN THE DINING ROOM IN FRONT OF OTHER DINERS????????

I'm speechless....

Not even interested In going into the med rare cook with blood pooling on my plate when it was suppose to be Med Well, there would be no point..... 

A dining experience I'd rather forget...

I come from Vancouver, the city that pretty much invented the All You Can Eat Sushi, and over there we are grown up spoiled with excellent Japanese food at bargain prices. However, for the past 12 years I have been to countless of these AYCE sushi factories, and I had given up hope that any would be worth the money, whether in Vancouver or else where. So you can imagine my surprise when I came to this place and experienced the best AYCE experience of my life... And in Totonto of all places! The food here is just delicious, and the price worth every penny. The only downside is that the sashimi and the overall quality of fish is only as good and fresh as it gets in Ontario, which is not great by Westcoast standards. Other than that, everything is fantastic, especially the brown rice rolls, and many of the grill and pan fried items from the kitchen.... Dam, that egg plant teriyaki alone was worth the admission price. Most importantly, although you are getting the AYCE option, the portions are still dignified and nicely presented. This is in sharp contrast to almost all places when you opt for the AYCE they insult you as if you are a lower class citizen by bringing sashimi orders that are cut sliver thin or limited to max orders, or by 2 inch thick rolls of rice in the makis, or by putting a peanut sized fish on top of a mountain of rice and calling it nigri, all in their illusion that this somehow maximizes their profits, and the idiotic AYCE customers will still come back to eat that garbage. Nope, this place obviously operates by the right philosophy that if you provide good food at good value, people will come. I will be for sure, keeping fingers crossed that with increased popularity, this place won't start cutting corners and drift down in their quality.

You like Japanese food, and you eat a lot? Run, don't walk to this place and indulge in the deliciousness my friend.",8,1,1

So we show up at the Sunset Station because Yelp says that this is the place to go.  Not knowing what the hell we were supposed to do, the clerk patiently attempted to explain what our options were in buying into the game.  We threw ourselves into it and walked over to a table carrying a bunch of papers with numbers on them.  Next we paid a visit to the dauber vending machine and were ready to play.

While waiting for the 3:00 game I rolled up to bar and while they only have domestic beer, I was happy to hear that it was free!

When they game kicked off I was absolutely lost in the sauce and feeling a tad frustrated due to my lack of Bingo prowess.  I thought that the experience would go the way of some church Bingo setting but was I wrong.  The games go on and you have to figure it out as you stamp along.

When it was all said and done, I was mentally exhausted and covered in dauber ink after playing 13 games in approximately 50 minutes.

But I learned something............

Who where those people I saw chilling out enjoying their drinks staring at their little black boxes while I freaking out over whether I heard or saw letters and numbers??

They of whom I speak had paid a little extra for the electronic Bingo option.  This excellent use of technology plays your cards on whatever game happens to be going on at the time.  It will chirp at you when you are one away and sing a little tune when you Bingo.  I don't know what Bingo purist think of the boxes but I did see some HARDCORE Bingo people playing the cards in addition to the Bingo boxes.

So we stayed for the 5:00 game and though we did not win a damn thing we stared at our boxes all the while holding hands and enjoying our drinks.

Now addicted to Zombie electronic Bingo we stayed for the 7:00 game.  With each start time the room got progressively more crowded.  But even with a packed house it was amazing how quiet the room.  Only the sound of the caller, daubers, chirps and cheer of a winner or winners.

Again we did not win a damn thing but did get see someone win $18,000.

I received a hot plate with cold food. They were actually cold inside so I am not sure if they sat that long or if they are premade and were not heated through. 
It took a long time but I finally got the attention of the waiter and asked him to please heat them up. 
He grabbed the plate and came back later with them hot. The crepes were still undercooked and mushy but the inside was hot.  The salad was wilted when he returned.  The waiter never said he was sorry or is it better or kiss my behind.  He just dropped it off and went away.  I did eat a couple more bites and decided that I was not willing to eat calories when the food is bad so that was the end of my dinner.
My husband had the Tuna Sandwich and it was different then they used  to make it and no longer on the menu that he could find.

Apparently she was trying a new way of removal, in that the strips were for each individual finger. That was probably almost two hours of trying to remove the existing shellac.

We arrived around 11:30 on a Sunday morning and were told we would have to wait 20-30 minutes since we hadn't made a reservation. Ok, fine that seemed reasonable enough and maybe would be a testament to the quality of the restaurant, I figured. Time easily killed by a walk around downtown. The hostess said that we could leave our phone number with them, and they would call us when it was our turn to be seated. A nice touch, I thought.

We never received that phone call, but wandered back of our own accord some 15-20 minutes later, and our table was ready. We received menus promptly, and then spent the next fifteen minutes waiting for our waiter. 

When he finally showed up he did apologize for not coming by sooner, asked us if it was our first time there (yes, for myself and one other in my party), and then proceeded to describe Radio Maria's menu: the uniqueness of the Mexican inspired breakfast items, the deliciousness of the omelettes, etc. I think I would have really appreciated that primer if I had not already had the opportunity to read over the menu several times while we had been waiting for him to show up. He seemed really startled when we informed him we were actually ready to order, because clearly he was not ready to take them, citing the drinks he had to bring to another table. So cue another wait...

All in all, we saw two tables that had been seated after us order food, receive their food, finish eating, and pay in the before we had gotten ours. Which points to less of a systemic problem (because, clearly, some patrons DO get their food in a timely manner), and maybe more of an individual issue. Our waiter did seem very harried, and I would venture to say even distressed, so maybe there is an issue with the division of work. I did notice that another employee stepped to help with water refills, but during only the last quarter of our meal.


FOOD : 
We ordered: two veggie masa boats, vegetarian Eggs Benedict, Mexican coffees,and a side of beer bread.

Rated from best to worst:
Veggie masa boats (4.5\/5): perfectly cooked eggs, and the masa black bean and tomato combo worked for me. What did not work: the goat cheese. I actually would have liked something a wee bit less salty and more melty, but I was in the minority at my table on this one.

Vegetarian eggs Benedict (4\/5): I guess I am used to versions with meat, but I could have done with a little more salt or other sort of seasoning. The slice of tomato\/avocado combination didn't do anything for me.

Beer bread (2\/5): really dry and cakey

Mexican coffee (1\/5): Came with a half-inch of spice grounds at the bottom, and was cloyingly sweet (The upside to this is that a refill of regular coffee, added to the grounds, makes for an actually drinkable beverage).


Overall... meh. I could overlook the service issues if the food were truly crave-worthy, but I did not find that to be the case.",2,1,0

It was so big a lady across from us thought it was some type of cake\/dessert. It was so much food wrapped up into a roll that it grossed me out. The server then came back and when I told her that the roll was way too big and that she should've told me that this roll was going to be my entire meal, all she and the moron up front had to say was ""Well, we're not called XTREME for nothing,"" and proceeded to laugh together. It was the biggest joke of service I have ever encountered. Overall, I'll say that the food for the most part is sub-par. They do use way too much rice on their rolls and everything seems like it's done half-assed. The service on the other hand, is flat out atrocious.

I used to find the food really excellent here but today's  food wasn't that great.  Back in the day, I was probably more impressed with the food because there wasn't as much choice as today.  None  of the congee queens, towns, etc existed then.  But with these places now open up everywhere, this place just doesn't offer much of a superior product. 

The congee today was a tad runny for me and there wasn't much meat in the congee either.   The steamed rice rolls weren't smooth and were quite small.  Two smallish bowls of congee and two small plates of rice rolls came to $16.70, so not much value for money either.

The outside patio was great, especially for a group from the frozen north who don't sit outside to eat in December.  The menu was adequate, with a good selection for lunch.  Chips and salsa were interesting, mild.  Food was well prepared and portions generous for the price paid.  Service was good.  Overall, a good, but not outstanding experience.",0,0,0

I think the only reason I come here is for the Horchata drink to be honest because it's made by a machine (not them). They take FOOOREEEVVVERRRR to get my food. This is supposed to be fast food. Quick! I'm not in a full service restaurant that I have to wait 20 minutes for my food. The place in the kitchen is a dump. I know since they leave the door open on my way to the restrooms (which you should stay away from). Chemicals next to prep table (near food!!!)  NO BUENO!  Meat was sitting out in the back. I'm not sure how long that was there. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.

 They have terrible, terrible service. It is always a girl with no uniform wearing regular unprofessional clothing . I'm not judgmental, but she has bracelets and rings on. When you work in food service, you are NOT allowed to have jewelry anywhere near your hands. She could pass on germs and bacteria from the jewelry onto the food. Ok fine. But when someone touches their face and hair and then goes back in the kitchen without washing her hands? I kind of shutter. I've worked in restaurants for so long, that it's just hard for me to NOT notice bad hygienic practices even if to the average person, seems pretty picky. Hey, at least i know the Maricopa County Food Code!

She always takes my order like, ""Ugh, I can't text and I have to take your order????"" 

I once ordered tacos and it was filled with guacamole. Don't get me wrong I love guacamole, but when I order carne asada tacos, I want to taste the meat, too! So I told the girl, excuse me but...these are waaay overpowered by guacamole. She says ""sorry, I cant make you new ones."" WHAT? Seriously? You served me bad food, and I came here for a decent meal. She said, ""do you want me to pick off the avocado? Well, actually, you can do it yourself?""  Well.Okaaaaay? Thanks....I'll eat disappointed. I don't know why I deal with terrible places that don't care about the customer. I think it's just become it's the norm with fast food. Anyway, it's not really worth coming here.",3,0,0

I'm not super in to the whole ""clubbing"" thing, so when my roommates friends visited, and they changed the plans to ""dancing"" I can't say I was thrilled. However, we decided to try out Cabin Five and had a great time! 

Though I do agree that the stairs going in are completely ridiculous for any establishment with alcohol, they were kind of hilarious and fun. We paid $10 cover (annoying, since guest list apparently doesn't get you anything), and even when I tried to play the ""It's my birthday"" card (ok, it wasn't my birthday), I still had to pay the full $10. 

When we got into the bar, I was immediately HORRIFIED that I had paid $10, as there were ACTUALLY only four other people in the entire place! We were trying to think of an escape plan, but decided to stick it out, and I'm happy I did! It got packed around 12:30, and a ton of Canuks fans celebrating a win came in which really added to the fun, casual atmosphere. We ended up dancing until around 2:30, and the place was still packed. 

The main drawback of this place was that the DJ was switching songs all over the place, which is sooooo annoying. I see that tons of others have commented on the same thing (I now hope the DJ reads this and fixes it!).

I love a place where I can go, dance, have cheap drinks, AND wear flats the whole time without feeling like a fool. 

Bonus: drinks were only $3.50, which made the $10 cover seem much more legitimate.",4,0,2

A few days before our trip, my sister in law arrived 90 minutes before her flight and they got bumped. We had to pay $200 to get her on a different flight even though she got there ON TIME! To ensure that we didn't run into the same problems, we confirmed our tickets the night before and arrived at 5:30am for a 9am flight. We thought we were doing good, but ran into a massive roadblock at customs! They had everybody sit down until they called out your departure time. We wasted over 2 hours waiting just to be ALLOWED TO GET IN LINE for customs! Let me repeat that...we waited 2 hours JUST TO BE ALLOWED TO GET IN LINE!!! They finally announced our departure time and we got into the massively long line. About 10 minutes later, they asked the 9am group to skip the line and report directly to the front area because our flight was leaving soon. What a cluster***k! By the time we fought through the crowd and cleared customs (our meeting with the customs agent only took about 90 seconds by the way) our flight showed the ""Final Call"" warning! We had to run the length of the airport to reach our gate but finally made it aboard the plane. 

Some of the things that pissed me off:
1) We have relatives who work at that airport and were told later that this type of crap happens every morning. The airport KNOWS that this is a problem and they're not doing anything to fix it!
2) We pretty much got penalized by following their instructions and arriving early! We could have slept for another 2 hours and gotten there at the last minute to achieve the same results.
3) If we ignored the stupid rules about waiting in the designated areas and just hovered near the front of the line, we would have bypassed the mass of humanity and saved a chunk of time. Many people arrived well after us but got processed faster because they knew to ignore the announcements. The airport's system rewards people for ignoring their own rules.
4) I understand there are delays at airports. I understand that there are delays with customs. I understand that there are long lines at airports. These are all parts of the traveling experience. My problem is that we can go out of our way to follow all of the rules, get everything ready beforehand, arrive extremely early, and still manage to get bumped from our flight and be expected to pay an adjustment fee. We would have definitely missed our flight if I didn't SPRINT across the freaking airport to arrive on time!

From my recent experiences, I must say that this airport unequivocally SUCKS! Unfortunately, you are left with few alternatives. What else would you do if you have to travel? Drive down to the Buffalo airport? The rest of my trip to Canada was great, too bad it had to end on such a crappy note.",5,0,0

I'm sure she does great work, but I can only rate the pedicure I had today. I don't know the name of the woman who did it, because she didn't speak to me. Now granted, I prefer it that way.... but a little engaging would have been nice. I ended up getting the $40 pedicure because it included callous removal which I really needed. It also came with a paraffin wax and something else, maybe a longer massage? Anyway, the pedicure was just ok. The salon itself is very small. The spa chairs are extremely close together so I was almost touching arms with the stranger next to me. Everything in the salon looked old. The techs did not use new tools like I am used to at the other salon I frequent. I'm hoping they were at least sterilized. When my nail tech left me and went to someone else, I didn't notice if she got new sterilized tools or not now that I think about it. The callous removal that I needed the most was subpar. My feet are not as smooth as they should be but I didn't notice until I had left. They do a mask on your feet and a sugar scrub and hot rocks, all of which I believe are part of the regular pedi. The mask does nothing really. I'd rather skip that and just get a longer massage. All of the treatments result in your feet being wrapped in plastic bags which is not great for the environment.

o6zatBVcvVA9jgf66fZHNg,EDfEcGni8rKB0bvFGWoIKA,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,3,2014-01-14,"My stay at LVH was from December 28 through December 31, 2013.

Overall, I felt the hotel was an acceptable venue. The room was comfortable, but showed signs of age, and the same could be said about the hotel as a whole. I think it's a reasonable choice for anyone looking for easy access to The Strip (via the Monorail) without paying Strip prices. A more detailed review follows.

We received a room on the 19th floor of the North Tower, which has not yet been remodeled. The elevator bank had five elevators, but as far as we could tell, only four were operational. There were multiple times of day requiring very long waits (up to five minutes) to get an elevator, and when going down, we'd often stop at almost every floor, frequently leaving people behind because there was no more room. When leaving our room, we took to pushing the ""up"" button and riding to the top just so we'd be guaranteed an elevator.

The room itself was a fairly average hotel room. It was clear that it was older and in need of remodeling. The most disappointing aspect was the television. I'd read online that the room would have a flatscreen TV, so I brought along an HDMI cable in the hopes of streaming video from my laptop. However, the TV was one of the oldest type of flatscreens I'd ever seen, and therefore had no HDMI connection. The picture itself was problematic because the aspect ratio was set to something odd and stretchy, and we were unable to fix it because there was no aspect button on the remote, and the ""menu"" button on the TV itself had either been disabled or was broken. On the positive side, the bed was quite comfortable, the room was clean, the bathroom was a decent size, and the tub was large. The shower pressure was on the weaker side, but not so much as to be problematic. I was also pleased that the a\/c unit, while definitely old, worked well and was not annoying noisy when cutting off and on.

The dining that we did within the hotel was actually very good. We enjoyed meals at Benihana and at the Burger Bistro. Both were quite tasty. We were very surprised, however, to find that when we went to the Burger Bistro on a Saturday night, they were closing at 9pm. We took a seat at 8:45 without knowing this, and quickly found ourselves to be the only guests. However, the serving staff was still very pleasant and helpful, and did not seem bothered by our late arrival. 

My biggest frustration with the hotel related to their tennis facility. I was very excited to see that they had tennis on the premises, including a pro shop, and I had my tennis gear with me. The hotel advertised that the facilities were open daily from 9am to 5pm, and the pro shop was open until 3pm. So I headed down with my gear, and initially could not figure out how to even get to the pro shop. Many of the signs were faded and difficult to read, and I found that the main path, which is through the pool area, was closed off since the pool was closed. Eventually, I was directed by someone at the spa to walk around, which involved walking over a strange gravel path, behind the mechanical equipment on the roof of the building. And, as you might have guessed, when I got to the pro shop, it was closed, and all of the tennis courts were locked up. The sign on the door indicated that someone would return in 15 minutes, but it was fairly obvious looking inside that no one had been there that day, and probably in quite some time beyond that. I called the phone number on the door and left voicemail, but I never heard back from anyone for the duration of the trip.
I'm not much for shopping in these sorts of properties, so I don't feel like I can comment much on how interesting the stores were. We visited the gift shop a couple of times for sundries and found what we needed. A sweets shop appeared to be on the verge of opening, and the only other store I recall was focused on items with bling. 

My last comment would be regarding the parking. We parked consistently in the lot for the North Tower, which is a multi-story structure with no physical attachment to the hotel. Getting to the hotel involved a bit of a walk, including crossing an internal ""street."" I watched a number of people struggle to lug luggage across this path, and I couldn't help but think how miserable that would be in extreme cold or heat or rain. Certainly not ideal.

Despite the complaints, I would still be willing to stay here again, although it would not be my first (or second or third) choice. It's a functional hotel with a few perks, but it has quite a ways to go in order to be on par with its Strip counterparts. Hopefully, the construction we were able to see during our stay means they're working on it.",0,0,0

The atmosphere, decor and pricepoint of Snooze is well suited for Kierland Commons. There was no wait and we were quickly able to be seated at an outdoor table. Our server Sarah took our order. Between my husband and I, we ordered a Benny and a 3 egg omelet. The meal was nicely presented and we got our order in under 10 minutes. Though it was good, I wouldn't have considered the meal memorable or outstanding in any way since it's hard to mess up over easy eggs or toast. I had a little serving cup on my plate that had a very tiny amount of jam (barely enough to spread on one half of my toast) so that was a little annoying. I didn't even want to bother with asking for butter to spread on my toast since it seemed like they were being flaky with giving out anything to accompany my toast. The service Sarah provided was sufficient, but she seemed pretty flat especially after we both only ordered ice waters with our meal. Hubby and I usually do not not normally cheap out on skipping on a usual soda, juice or tea, but we just weren't feeling it yesterday. Our bill including tip was under $30 since we did not order coffee or a fun drink. I'm sure this place is packed on weekends. Though it was nice to try this place out, we will likely not come back unless we have guests in town visiting us. Would I ever wait more than 30 minutes for awesome breakfast?

I was attempting to use a certificate to book one of three nights.  I found that I couldn't make it work with the full three nights so I booked it for just the Thursday stay.  Then I attempted to book Friday and Saturday and could not.  My daughter had just booked it so I called the front desk.  They were very friendly and let me know they were sold out and only available to Platinum members.  (I then realized there were home Pitt and Steeler football games that weekend.)

Luckily, my daughter is a platinum member.  She booked the other two nights for us.

Upon our early arrival they were able to accomodate our check-in request.  As we were unloading our bags, the gentleman who checked us in returned my sunglasses that I had left on the counter.  I always appreciate honesty!

The room that my daughter booked for us was not the same type room we had.  The front desk staff was not phased in the least, they saved our room so that we didn't have to move after the first night.

Upon checkout I was able to easily change the Marriott rewards to my number from my daughter's.

I don't mean it as a compliment, but I also understand the need for such places. It is regular Mexican fair at double the price. Maybe it's necessary because of the expense of the DS location. Yes, the food is good, not great, but I wasn't disappointed. The salsa actually had a kick to it. It wasn't watered down. But $15 for a burrito with no sides? I've tried to argue that I could've gotten the same burrito at Cardenas or Roberto's for half that, easy. But then again, Roberto's and Cardenas market food court isn't exactly where Summerlinites would go out for a family meal or a date. I get it.

Just look around you. How many actual hispanic people do you see there (besides the employees)? ZERO. Why would that be? I personally don't eat at Korean restaurants where there are no Koreans eating there no matter how nice the place looks. But I still gave them the benefit of the doubt because of the demographics of Summerlin. But Vegas as a whole has a big enough Hispanic community that you would see at least one person eating here on a busy Saturday afternoon if this place was really that good. The Michiochan restaurants are full of Hispanic families.

The entire decor is designed to attract the non Hispanic Summerlin crowd into thinking they're eating ethnic food without having to drive down to questionable parts of town to do so. I would rather eat at Cardenas market and get similar quality for half the price. But yes, it's not a viable option for some people. Again, I get it. So you must pay double for the atmosphere. 

But the final punch in the gut was paying $9.99 for a kids meal that was 1\/3 frijoles, 1\/3 rice, and 1 enchilada (or 1 taco, but to make it a fish taco was extra $). NO DRINKS included.

I selected Hy's because I haven't had steak in a while and I'd never been to this Toronto classic. I don't think I'll be back.
The space is very nice, though the lighting is almost too dim. The service was excellent. The food was just ok. 

We had: 

Caesar salad - 3\/5 this is prepared table side, and is not as tasty as I would have liked. This is not a creamy caesar, but a caesar vinaigrette made with a base of anchovy paste, some tobasco and Worcester, an egg and some red wine vinegar. The server who prepared it was lovely, the salad was a bit on the fishy side for my taste. 

Filet mignon for 2 with vegetables (prepared table side) - 3\/5. I felt the steak was bland. I liked the vegetables. But if you're not into eating healthy, you won't. I think they were steamed. 

Creamed spinach - 5\/5 this was perfection! 

We didn't have desert.

Drinks (bubble teas, hot teas, coffee), Appetizers, Taiwanese snacks, Asian desserts, Ramen, Stone Pot Rice, Main dishes with rice... the problem is when you try to do too much, you can't do anything well. 

I find the menu here is a hit and miss. Some items are good, like the fried fish cakes (deep fried, piping hot, good order size, sitting on a bed of pickled radish and so delicious), and some items are not so good like the bimbimbap (missing egg, seaweed, bean sprouts, kimchi... when asked the waitress why the dish did not have half the items shown in the picture, she said the menu is old and they haven't changed it yet. So for $9, my friend got a really big bowl of rice and some carrots, some beef.. and I'm not sure what else there was.....). 

My order came out pretty decent. I got the satay beef with rice. The plate of beef was huge, and the dish was overflowing with onions. good value for $10. The flavour wasn't immersed in the meat though, and some pieces tasted pretty bland. I also got the soy tofu with ginger for dessert. It was very gingery and hot which made it perfect for winter. The syrup was served on the side so you can choose how sweet you want it to taste. 

Overall, I think this place is good for desserts or snacks and to chat in (the setting and environment is perfect to catch up with friends) but this is NOT the place to eat a good meal.

Since then I have not heard anything from anyone at the dealership.  I have tried:

1.  Sending the sales associate an email (12 hours after he told me someone would be contacting me) letting him know that no one had gotten in touch with me and that I guess they had sold the car (so it wasn't important to them to get in touch with me).
2.  Calling the sales associate the next day during business hours and leaving a voice mail message asking him to call me.
3.  Emailing to the ""General Manager"" identified in the ""welcome"" emails.  By the way, the email address in the ""welcome"" email bounced.
4.  Emailing the ""Operating Partner"" as identified on their website letting him (and the General Manager) that no one had contacted me.

My only conclusion is that they must have sold the car (which is still on their website as I write this) and don't believe that the courtesy of telling me that is important.

Ryan and I were having a Mini Vacation out in Vegas December 14-17th; My friends always come to Vegas (my best friend is Dating someone from out there) and I had only been to Vegas once in my entire life for a little less than a day. 

I decided that since I've stepped into this town without the faintest idea of what I'm doing, I'll holler at my friends who are no strangers. They suggested Grand Lux; I had never heard of this place before even though its a chain and I didn't even know it was part of the Cheesecake Factory family until I Yelped it (Like the good yelper I am, I referred to my iPhone app to spy on this place before diving in)* and was relieved to find that it got pretty good reviews. 

We ate here twice. First time was yum nummy.

Lunch: 
--Buffalo chicken rolls HOLY COW good; 
--Ryan's Enchilada lunch special was very good
--My chicken salad\/house salad\/chicken and mushroom soup was.. a little bland, it was okaaay, but It needed SOMETHING. Finished my salad the vinaigrette was good. 

They have some pretty good lunch deals which are HUGE servings even for lunch. The Buffalo chicken rolls were soo good, I crave them all the time. 

Dinner (the next day) 
--Ryan got Crispy Caramel Chicken with Rice which was pretty good although we were a bit apprehensive about the caramel part. 

++Now here's where they lose points++
--I got the flat bread spicy chicken sandwich which was HORRIBLE! Bland Bland; Flat bread was tough and tasted like cardboard, chicken was bland and tasted like Subway ""roasted chicken"" the spicy mayo was gross and the fries were way too crunchy & COLD. I was so disappointed. 

--Good thing I was able to get a little full from the Buffalo Rolls we ordered again. 


It seemed like I got the short straw here.. My food was never that great, but Ryan's was waaay better. Almost like a different place. Put I do give it points for having some good things on the menu, but I have to take some away for being kind of inconsistent. 


So I struggle with the stars here. I wouldn't kick GLC out of bed though. I'll come back here again because for two 21 year old struggling college students, the prices weren't bad at all. I'll come back. But I just wish the place was consistent.

In the span of about 30 minutes I watched as several customers who came in after me (and better dressed than me) had their problems fixed while I continued to wait patiently. My friend who came with me (who was dressed nice) was approached about a possible appointment minutes after setting foot in the door. He said no and the employee admitted that his fellow colleagues will completely ignore customers at times. When I finally asked why I hadn't been helped the employee said they had canceled my appointment. (Why, I am not sure) He then went on to say that next time I should speak up if I didn't want the same thing to happen again. Almost as if the problem was my fault. In my opinion the issue could've been solved with some better customer service.

Service was good. My friends who were getting married got a nice mexican buffet set up with a open bar. As you would've figured, we all got wasted and ate a bunch of food which was pretty delicious. The decor was pretty nice but unfortunately it got a little dirty since the only time the marrying couple had was during the summer to get married and it turned out that it was going to sprinkle a little bit preceeding a heavy dust storm.

When we walked in, we stood around for around five minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. While there is a stand by the front door, there was no one who seemed to be stationed there.

Once we were seated, we were able to order our beers - which were very tasty! I had the Erie Railbender and my boyfriend had the East End Big Hop. Those beers came fairly quickly.

The food took a very long time. We probably waited around half an hour for our food. The food was pretty good. I liked it, but it was definitely very salty. All the food is a la carte, so even though the individual prices are low, you need to get a few items to put together an entire meal.

I was planning to order another beer, but our waitress never came back to talk to us until we were finished with the food.

It sort of felt like there were not enough employees working. We saw multiple people standing around waiting for someone to help them. It didn't seem like anyone was assigned to seat customers, because each waitress would ask if someone had helped whoever was standing there yet.

First, there was no wait to get seated, which is always appreciated. Nothing super exciting about the atmosphere, just a regular breakfast spot with a ""cafe style"" theme.

Food: The food was edible. I ordered the French Toast (my usual at the Tempe location) and it was a bit dry and way too thick... I would say that I ate about half. The bacon was weird, had a melt in your mouth kind of feeling but at the same time it was also very overdone.

Service: The service was slow... and random. I had to wait for syrup until a few minutes after receiving my French Toast (super annoying) and I was consistently waiting for a refill on my coffee. Nice server, but seemed a bit disorganized.

I go out to eat for the food (because I can't cook) and for the service. I guess I kind of expect really good food and attentive service. I don't really feel like I got that during today's visit, however the price was decent. Not a cheap breakfast, but not an expensive one where I felt robbed.

Before it was a KFC and a Taco Bell I'm pretty sure. It is in a very good location because the school That I'm currently going to is a 3 minute walk to get to there during the lunch period. But that can also be a negative because there is a horrible line up during the lunch hour. 

Secondly it is right near a funeral home so there is probably lots of people coming from there also. 

Now onto the food. 
If they are busy you will get your items very fast and they will taste fine. However if you go at a off time like 6 or so in the evening when people are having dinner, surprisingly you will have to wait longer and somehow the food doesn't seem to be as good. 

I will give it to them though that of all the iced coffees I have had the one from here is usually the best. 

I will also add that once I had a slice of pizza with me and I was sitting at a table with some friends who all had ordered drinks and sandwich's from the Tim hortons and the manager came to me and told me to get out because I had outside food in her store. I refused and told her I'm not leaving 
And she said she was doing to call the cops. I said go ahead and she didn't. 
MAIN POINT IS THAT I ALSO BOUGHT A $4 drink from here at the same time as the pizza. She never bothered me again though.",0,0,0

We arrived around 1:30 pm and they were quite busy. However, we were seated and helped very quickly. Service is pretty good for a new restaurant. The restaurant is very open and the decor is nice. It looks way nicer than Congee Dynasty.

What I didn't like was that we had to pay for the dinner price even when we were there during lunch time. So regardless of the time if you go on weekends you're paying $22.99\/person. Additionally, you are charged anywhere from $1.50-$2.50 for the soup. I thought the soy milk was included in the price but it's an additional $1.50.

By the time we left we were stuffed! The food was good and the broth was tasty. I really enjoyed the seafood options. Other hot pot places give you a limit on how much seafood you could get. However, it looks like you are allowed three rounds of orders based on the order sheet.

I'll definitely be back!",8,2,4

A week ago, I made an appointment for 8\/24 to drop my car off for an oil change, check engine light and a rattling noise coming from the rear left. I dropped my car off yesterday at 7:30 am (as soon as they opened) and was shuttled to my job by 8. No problems. As of 1 o'clock, I still hadn't heard anything about my vehicle, so I decided to call and received the voicemail of the garage. At 2:30, I still hadn't heard anything back, so I called again. I spoke to a mechanic who told me they were just starting to look at my car and he would have information for me soon. Why when they had my car for 7 hours were they just starting to look at it at 2:30? 

At 4 o'clock, I STILL had no diagnosis on my car. My work day was over at 4:30 and I was relying on someone else to give me a ride to pick up my car. I called at 4 and all of a sudden, there was a huge list of things wrong with my car. I needed front brakes and rotors, the rear left rotor was locked and the wheel wouldn't spin, my engine cylinders were clogged. They wanted $1500 for this work. I asked them if the repairs could wait and they told me my car wasn't in driving condition. I brought it into the shop in driving condition so why couldn't I leave with it? I know their prices were off the wall and I wanted to get a second opinion elsewhere. 

As a young 23 year old woman, I knew they were trying to scare me into getting these repairs done. With the advice of my father, we decided to get the brakes done, but not the cylinders for a friend's husband or father could fix it for less than $10. When I told my ""service advisor"" this, she went into a long rant about it was caused by me using cheap gas like Sheetz or GetGo, and it can cause my entire engine to fail and ruin my car. It was complete over dramatics, and luckily, as a woman, I know to question what people are repair shops tell me and get a second opinion. 

After speaking to them at 4, they informed me that there was no way my car would be done that day because their mechanics left for the day. I asked her why they didn't start looking at my car until 2:30 when I dropped it off at 7:30 in the morning. She told me they'd been working on it all day, even though the mechanic told me himself they had just started looking at it at 2:30. Had they been working on it all day, I'd think they'd call me with a diagnosis a lot sooner than 4 pm. 

So at that point, it was 4 pm. Mechanics were gone. My car is not in driving condition (according to them). And I'm stuck at work without a car. Had they looked at my car in the morning when I dropped it off, there would have been plenty of time to repair it that. I was never offered a rental to get to work today, so thankfully I have good friends who were willing to bring me to work and take me to pick up my car. They did not care one bit about the position I was left in without a car. I will be picking up my vehicle later this afternoon, paying $1134 for brakes and an oil change and never looking back.

We started with the Mega Meatball, which had decent marinara and ricotta.  I got the porcini ravioli with mascarpone, which wasn't ravioli at all.  Instead, it was giant sheets of pasta dough folded over.  Each of the four ""raviolis"" was about six inches wide.  The mascarpone itself was way too tangy and rich (it didn't seem to have anything added to it).  The sundried tomatoes were really hard and they didn't add to the dish.  It was lazy.

My husband got the flounder, which might have been the worse presentation I have ever seen.  It looked like something that you would get from a diner for $8. The side of mashed potatoes was under-seasoned and unimpressive.

The ""creme brulee"" had no hard shell on top and it tasted like frozen cheesecake.  Drinks were okay--too expensive (9.50 for a gin and tonic, and no questions from the server about what gin was preferred).

Costs here are astronomical for the quality of food that you are getting.  In the end, we spent about $150 for an appetizer, drinks, entrees with one side, and dessert.  That wouldn't be bad if they put care into their food, but they don't. Go somewhere else!",0,0,0

Once inside, there was ONE location to purchase tokens (required for almost every food purchase available). Spent about 20 minutes just to get the tokens and then let loose inside of the festival.  There were a ton of choices and my friend and I sampled a bunch of tacos.  Blanco (Scottsdale) and Joy Ride (central PHX) were my two faves BY far.  Both trucks had employees with great personalities and the tacos they dished out were delicious.  One bad experience was attempting to buy a churro for dessert.  When asked how many tokens the churros were, the guy said ""6"". Each token is worth $2 meaning that the guy was charging $12 for a 10 inch churro.  I asked him (politely, of course) how he could possibly get away with charging such a ridiculous amount for a churro and he said that the festival takes 50% of the dollar amount of the tokens they receive and he needed to make a profit.  Still....$6 walk away for a churro.  Come on, dude.  Now you're just being ridiculous. Needless to say, we didn't buy any churros.
By 2pm, we had seen everything there was to see and were stuffed.  As we headed back to the parking lot, I was amazed to see what appeared to be around a thousand people waiting to get into the festival and the line to get token for food was just ridiculous.

The meat (chashu) also felt like it had been frozen for some time and was defrozen hastily. The overall taste and presentation was not authentic. It's neither Japanese or Chinese, at least. While it's a relieving that they have bamboo shots (some ramen restaurants in New York don't!), it's not what ramen should taste like. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because I like their Chicken kara-age, which was way better than the ramen itself.

I went to there at late night 9 pm. Although restaurant was about to close, I had no problem entering and having meal there. When I was seated, there were five groups of people,  approximately 13 people were there. I was honestly surprised to see so many people in 9 pm.

The first thing I noticed was that the place was horribly disorganized and dirty. The ""sushi bar"" was fully filled with kitchen appliances that there is absolutely no space for a human being to sit down and have a meal. Also, there were dust all over the floor which made me to assume they have not cleaned or sanitized for a long time. The owner of this place should put more care to the sanitation of this place.

Despite the messy and dirty appearance inside, I gave myself a confidence that this place's food should be good since there are so many people in that late night plus some of my friends recommended me this restaurant.

The menu was quite vanilla, namely you can see such menu in any Japanese restaurant. There was appetizer, entree and dessert. As a person grew up in Japan, I found the menu quite boring and unfortunately, I could not find any outstanding characteristics of this restaurant.

I had a grill of saury and katsudon which is a pork frit on rice. Both dish had bit of problems in terms of their taste and how they are cooked. 

First, the saury grill was not fresh AT ALL. It came with guts, which I believe is quite common way to eat saury in Japan. However, if the fish is fresh, the guts should have a taste of bitterness and sweetness. In comparison, old saury gut tastes just strong bitter. Unfortunately, what I tasted was only bitterness, not sweetness or good fish flavor at all. The usual way to grill non-fresh saury is to remove all guts, because grilling the old fish with guts will make the edible part of fish smell and taste horrible. I was quite disappointed with my experience at that point.

Secondly, the katsudon was so thin and way over salted that there is barely no flavor of pork. The way they make katsudon did not impress me. Trust me, you do not want to eat a katsu (fried pork with panko) without any crunchy texture with it. The katsu was so small and thin, plus there was a wired flavor with it. I guess the flavor come from the sauce they use, but I do not have any idea what they use because I have never tasted a katsu like that. The egg with katsu was overcooked and over-salted. I highly doubt that this is done by a experienced chef. The miso soup was sour which is quite wired and not tasteful.

In my opinion, I think this place is good for people who have no experience with Japanese food, however, personally I would not recommend this place to my friend.",2,1,1

I was very excited as this is a cuisine that is relatively new to me.  Les Sabilano, the co-owner of Lamesa explained that his concept is to introduce Filipino food to the mainstream. The word ""Lamesa"" means ""table"", which is the epicentre of the Filipino home and that is the feeling they wanted to bring into the restaurant. 
We selected the $35 prix fixe tasting menu as we believed this would give us the variety we were looking for and put our journey in the hands of the talented Chef Rudy Boquila. 

We were immediately served a little shot glass of watermelon juice as a palette cleanser. It was quite refreshing for a hot summer evening. The first dish was amazing: lumpia asado (Filipino spring rolls) with soy glaze. I have definitely had chinese and thai rolls and these are similar, but with a uniqueness to them as well. The next dish was one of my favourites of the evening was their coconut and corn soup - such a lovely balance of flavours with a velvety texture. I would go back and order a big heaping bowl of this soup.
Next we were brought a delicate house made crepe with sinigang in it, which is a sour stew with a heavy influence of tamarind. It was very flavourful.  Fourth up was a dish of sisig halo halo.  ""Halo halo"" literally means ""mix mix"" which in this case is a blend of chicken, pork, beef with a fried egg and a pico de halo sauce over it served in a small iron skillet. You are encouraged to break the egg and mix it up with the different meats and it was amazing. We also had a helping of their pancit which is traditionally made with shrimp, but for our meal was substituted with mushrooms as my dinner date, Carlos had a shellfish allergy. This is a noodle stir fry dish mixed with veggies and while it is simple, it has a good texture and balance of flavour. After five dishes we still weren't done! We had only just begun as those were all our appetizers! Can you believe it?

Our mains were plated next -a juicy beef short rib that falls off the bone placed atop a pineapple carrot puree and olive tapenade which adds this sour\/sweet element to the dish. My favourite main was the pork belly adobo: a confit of pork belly served with soy, vinegar and a smear of black garlic puree. The belly was crispy and so flavourful and was complimented well with the sides on the plate.
We were so full at this point and so satisfied. Carlos commented that this was a novel place where it adapts the traditions from the Philippines and innovates them through plating, deconstructing flavours and elevating simple dishes. Finally our desserts came - we got a few of them. We had a house made soft cheese cake which looked like a scoop of soft ice cream and it was heavenly. Even Carlos, who is not a fan of cheesecake, licked his spoons. We also had their jackfruit creme brûlée and it was sweet and light. We were also given a trio of house made sorbets - young coconut, jackfruit and pineapple. Finally, there was a home made rice cookie and my very favourite, the turon, a purple yam stuffed empanada.  mmmmMMM! There were so many firsts for me in terms of dishes, new names, everything.

So, as the summer heat is now coming in I decided to get my hair cut again. I like my hair to be medium length (just slightly over my chest). The last time I got my hair cut I got no layers. I just asked straight blunt cut but after months of not being able to curl my hair I decided to ask for some layers. Now, I went in for a walk in and the same lady who did my hair last time was cutting it again. I loved my last cut so I had faith in this hair dresser (a bit older Asian lady, I wanna say her name is Joyce but I have no idea). I asked for around the same length but some layers as well. After a bit of reading I look up and see how short she had cut my hair. It was inches shorter than I asked, with too many layers AND she thinned out my already very THIN hair. My hair is the type of hair that dries in 5 mins and where my ears poke through constantly. I don't have hair. This haircut was a complete mess. I was hoping that when I got home I could maybe play around with how to make it work. Well, it's been 2 weeks and my hair has been in a bun every single day because I can't do anything with it. It makes me look old (like a mom [I'm 18 for Christ's sake]), sickly, and just doesn't suit my face. I have not been so disappointed in a haircut since I was like 7 years old. Will not be coming here again.

Place is clean and the service is quick, however, it was too quick.  The con about that is that you get your food which was pretty much pre-made from God knows what time. We ordered a couple of maki rolls and from the quality of it, it just seemed as though they had been sitting in the fridge as they were slightly cooler than room temperature.  Sure that's somewhat okay with the rolls but not so much dishes that are generally grilled such as teriyaki chicken and grilled eggplant.  

The teriyaki chicken was very cold as though it had literally just came out of the fridge.  The grilled eggplant was nice but again, it would've been better if it were warm at least.

The Volcano Roll was nothing but just crispiness on the inside with barely any salmon.  It was like they had taken some tempura crumbs and rolled it.  

One positive thing about this experience was that their sashimi portions were larger than what you would normally get at an AYCE.  That and ice cream.  Ice cream solves everything.  Well, almost everything since I wouldn't consider going back to this place.  Good ice cream, though.",1,0,0

Rude staff, especially the manager (didn't get his name but short guy, plump, Asian).  No ambiance, people with bored faces, hushed library-ish, tiny place, stale air, and NO reception.  The view is great, if this is the only bar with a view of Vegas you've been to.  After you've been to The Foundation Room you realize you wasted time at Skyfall. But what brought me to write a review is the horrible way my daughter and I were treated there.  We were there to celebrate her 21st birthday. She turned 21 three days before the trip, presenting a situation they see in Vegas on a regular basis of course.  To be safe we brought the voided license, the renewal form from the DMV when she renewed the license, her official birth certificate with a raised seal, her SS card, and her current school ID. We threw in her passport but it had also just expired, so we knew it was only useful alongside everything else.  But we went through TSA, and ALL of Vegas, and never needed ANYTHING except her license.  We were told by the TSA that for identity purposes the license is good for one year after it expires - you just can't drive with it.  Everyone in Vegas was obviously trained to this legality.  Apparently Skyfall missed the memo, and could use a few training sessions on respect for quests as well.  Within a minute of entering the manager was going through each document we brought and disdainfully rejecting each one with a look of joy I can only describe as a gleeful power trip.  No problem, we didn't need a drink.  We politely told him we understood and walked away. Since the Taxi there was pricey we decided to take in the view for a minute then leave.  But oh no, the manager is again immediately in our face demanding we leave, right now.  We were again polite, and we left.  But he did us the best favor! Immediately after getting off the elevator and beginning to walk, a promoter stopped us and asked if we'd like free cover and drinks at The Foundation Room.  So we went up, and WOW!!  What a difference five minutes made!  SOOO much better than Skyfall.  OPEN view of the strip, outside, CLASS, good music, nice people, and a great staff that gave us free shots (on top of the already free drinks) when I mentioned it was my daughter's 21st birthday weekend.  We were ecstatic the way it all happened because we would have never found The Foundation Room otherwise.  So thank you to the power-trip manager fighting Short Man Syndrome. You're the reason we had an amazing Saturday night in Vegas!  But in the future, you might want to learn the law so you don't force people from your club to another, especially when you're club is known for a view and there's one close by with a BETTER view.  You can kick anyone out that you want of course, but picking on a mom and her daughter is just a power trip.  With the MANY forms of ID we had, you KNEW she was 21, but your power trip was on low mileage at the moment I suppose, and you don't understand the law.  Bad combination.  You were the ONLY person within a three day trip to even ask for anything besides her license, let alone deny it.  THE ONLY PERSON! We went to many clubs at many hotels with NO problem. By your logic, all of Vegas is breaking the law except you lol.  But what led me to write this is how RUDE you were.  Everything else aside, there's just no reason for that.  We were extremely polite to you that night because nothing I could have said would have mattered.  But this does.  I saved it for here, and the other places I will copy\/paste it.  People have many choices when visiting Vegas, and limited time.  I appreciate reviews that help me avoid wasting time and money, so I'm returning the favor.

But I can look past that...hence, why I still managed to give them 2 stars (again, I won't blame them totally for a woeful lack of training).  It's when you take the product into consideration that drops their rating drastically.

We followed up with peanut butter pie which was great.  This is something not often seen in Canada, but was sooooo good.

Before we get to the light bulb point, let's step back and set the scene.

I'd been recommended this place by some colleagues who have been to Madison a lot for work. We looked it up and found there were a few locations for the group so we picked here as it was closer to Verona where we were staying and we thought we'd be able to park easier than near the capital (we were right there was a free car lot across the street).

We walk in and its packed! Thursday night and we were told it would be a 60min wait for a table for 2! But they said if we could find room at the bar or the high top tables we could just sit. So we hovered and almost left but I was thinking if it's this busy we really have to try it! We got super lucky and found a high top table and were set. We got our hands on the menu which was in the style of an old newspaper (cool!) and the menu was huge! We struggled to pick.... until I saw the fried chicken with shrimp, andoille sausage, artichoke and mushrooms with a side of mashed potatoes and jalapenos and seasonal veggies ... with a name like smothered and covered fried chicken it pretty much sums up an almost perfect meal for me.... sold! As I was ordering I was telling myself.. diet start tomorrow, diet starts tomorrow... salad only for the next week!

Food arrives... of course as expected large serve... and it is great. Chicken is crunchy fried and the toppings work well and the jalapeno mashed potatoes are great... a really nice spice that went well with the chicken.

Now to the official fatso moment.... the waitress comes over and sees my empty plate... it must not be a common occurrence as she looks over and audibly says ""wow"" and gives me a HIGH FIVE!... oh the shame... Diet starts tomorrow, diet starts tomorrow.

However, Brenda the Home Owners Association lady that works in the office is quite possibly the devil herself. She spends so much time telling tenants ""no"" and being hostile that it always feels like you are being watched or are in trouble. 

Three Examples: 
1. I have been living there for 2 years, I know everyone in the front office by name, they know me by name and unit number. I had a package at the front office and one of the gals went to get my package Brenda would not allow her to give it to me until the gal checked my ID.
 
2. I rented the club house to throw a party for some friends, it was a clothing swap where we donated donated our clothes to charity. Brenda withheld my deposit until I came back to the club house to push all the chairs in straight. Mind you, the rest of the place looked better when we left than before we came in.

3. We are regularly by the pool on the weekends and a big group of tenants all hang out and enjoy the facilities. Brenda put up signs and lectured everyone that we were not allowed to have any beverages, including water, within the pool area. We were told we needed to eat and drink over by the grills. 

We are good tenants. We aren't party animals, we aren't prudes. We are a young couple who is respectful, clean and friendly. We get along very well with many of the other tenants.

Ok guys. My friends and I had a great time at the run yesterday, but not because of anything other that being together in some nice weather at a run. Keep in mind that your event is about double the cost of an average 5k, so the expectation is that this will be a higher level event. 5 of us between a couple of cars dropped a fair amount of money to be there yesterday. 

When we signed up, you sold it as ""running through beautiful surroundings, running through the vineyards, blah blah."" We didn't expect the vineyards, let's be real, but after you posted your map it sort of felt like a bait and switch. ""Hey, let's advertise a run at beautiful Lake Las Vegas, then just have people keep on driving out to the middle of the ugliest, construction-dumpyard area you can find past Lake Las Vegas and set it up there."" 

That was VERY disappointing. Then, to add insult to injury, you charged $15 to park in a desert construction dump lot that was literally FULL of nails with a very dusty half mile walk to the event and back. Cars were driving around everywhere, so the dust was pretty bad, and I picked up 10 nails, just around my car. The lot attendant was incredibly rude as well. Very poorly run and disorganized.

During the run, people were tripping and falling over fist sized rocks throughout the entire course. Dangerous, and irresponsible on your part.

Now, let's talk about the wine part--what wine part?!! We had about 1 glass of wine, all red because you brought no white. The red wine you did bring seemed like it had been sitting for a long, long time. It was ""chunky"" in the bottom, from so much sediment, so not the best experience. The wine tasting part was completely overblown and very disappointing.

So, for next year, you really need to work on location, and if you want to call it a wine run, you need to kick that part up a notch--OR, charge less money, and don't charge people for parking just because you can. Pretty rude. 

Be honest about your event--one way or the other!",11,1,1

After not hearing from anyone, I called at 3pm.  Was informed my car had not even been looked at, if they don't get it done in an hour they will provide me with a car.  4:30 received a call that my car had not been done and to come pick up a car.  No other information was given.  When I went to pick up the car (which was way smaller than my Traverse) was informed that if I have a dog in the car it would be $100 fee.  I had to miss my class with my dog of which I pay for, just so I didn't get an additional charge for something that was not my fault.  Not only that was not told to bring my insurance card and when I told the guy that it was in my car he went to get my car and went through my glove box with out my permission! Gave me a very bad feeling about ever leaving my vehicle there again.  This was an inconvenience to me not having my vehicle.  Next morning still after no correspondence from the Service Manager I called and left msg.  Finally got word but was told that it would be over $600 to replace a couple of hoses.  Really? Nope!  Asked if the oil change had been done, NO.  Ok really!  That is the whole reason it was taken in.  Ask for just the oil change to be done and will deal with the other issue.  When SM called to tell me car was finally done ask my cost and was told $75.75!  Questioned it and said it was 19.99 for a tire rotation plus 49.99 for oil change.  Told him didn't authorize the tire rotation just said to do oil change, he did take off the tire rotation but it still cost $54 for an oil change.

- Huge place with a lot of places to sit
- Pitcher of beer is reasonably priced
- Free shots randomly through the night (Friday and Saturday I assume)
- Lights on the dance floor aren't terrible at all
- Lively crowd 
-They have beer pong...

DISLIKES
- Dj was playing top 20 type songs, if you like that then its another like for you but I wasn't into it at all
- Place seemed dirty with random chicken wings or chicken bones on the ground
- OVERPRICED, my biggest thing from this place was that the food was overpriced. It made me not wanna come back at all. I ordered Cajun Fries and what I got was a very depressed load of barely sprinkled on Cajun with some fries on the side. It wasn't worth the $5.00 I paid for it. Their $10 nachos sounded great but I kept on comparing it to mcmullens and it doesn't compare AT ALL. This place fails in comparison.
- Service wasn't good at all. Kept no eye contact and kept the answers short with no substance

I just waited over 15 minutes on hold to book an appointment for my daughter and she is an established patient.

Another big problem is their billing. Every time I bring  my daughter in for an appointment I insist that I pay the $40.00 copay and get a hard copy receipt. The reason for requesting the hard copy is because there is an occasional breakdown in their accounting system and mysteriously their billing system forgets you paid them for a visit or two from 3 or 6 months ago and tells the front desk clerk you owe them for the past visits and they attempt to double charge you. You must then go home and dig out your receipt from your files to prove to them that you paid. Very annoying and sometimes they are off a day or two when you request the dates from them to match up with your receipt. Good thing my personal calendar saves all our appointment days. 

Last issue is scheduling appointments in advance. You must make sure the clerk reconfirms all your appointments as you enter them on your mobile device. I have had at least 3 appointments that were off by a day in the past year. As an example we would come in on our scheduled time on Tuesday to be told our appointment is Wednesday not Tuesday so now we have a wasted trip.

They call it a buffet which it is NOT. The chef has to serve up everything that is hot. It is not a serve yourself buffet. The layout is confusing. The signage is misplaced and not helpful or accurate. The chef was grim and scary and not helpful - except to the pretty girls who ate after I did.
The cold fruit section had HOT plates and bowls, straight out of the dishwasher - too hot to pick up. Hot plates with cold food is a big no-no and pretty disgusting. I tried to get a different plate from the ""buffet"" section and the chef just stared at me when I asked for a plate. Luckily one of the servers gave me a plate from the line that was cold. Which brings up another point - cold plates for the hot food? Backwards and confusing.
So... How it works is you walk up to the hot counter and tell the chef what you would like (if he wants to pay attention to you) or if you are lucky one of the servers will be there to take your order. Yes, take your order. Wait... what happened to buffet? oh that's right it isn't. Oh wait, the advertising all says buffet. At this point I am confused and not really making any progress towards breakfast. I finally got it figured out because a server showed up and helped the guy behind me in line. I guess I looked too confused, which I was. 
So... I ordered a ham and cheese omelette. That's it. Shouldn't be difficult - except for the facts that, 1. the chef was running around like an idiot looking busy but not accomplishing anything (can you say spinning wheels?), 2. his having to cook eggs to order and man the ""buffet"" line made it really hard to take adequate care of customers or cook decently, and 3. he just wasn't a very good cook and obviously not happy and in over his head. The comment I heard from another table was, ""I can do better at home"". About 10-15 minutes later my omelette showed up. It was a mess. The cheese inside was not melted. No cheese on top. The whole thing was falling apart. It was just NOT UP TO HILTON STANDARDS. See attached picture. 
I told my server and she was really nice. She listened and then got the manager without my having to ask. The manager, Jennifer, was also really nice, She listened, apologized, and was genuinely interested in my experience, like a good manager should be. I know Hilton takes customer service seriously and she was a great example of the culture they try to maintain. She did explain that the Hilton Brand Standard requires that the staff dishes up the hot food. Understood. I don't agree but that is OK. I certainly do not fault her or the servers. However, the cook was not good and the buffet that isn't a buffet was very weird and confusing.  I did see Jennifer talking to the ""chef"" immediately after she left me. I don'tknow if it did any good.
My suggestion to improve this experience for future guests (which I mentioned to Jennifer) would be to have a hostess that could explain and direct the customers on how things work to lessen the confusion. Also make sure that the cook is only responsible for cooking and dedicate a server to the hot line. It would be WAY smoother and faster and would have to be better quality. AND get a new chef. This guy was not good. (Sat 2\/28) 
One last thing, for as expensive as a night's stay is, breakfast should be included, not $10.99. Siwng and a miss, Hilton.",2,1,0

This is a hidden gem in downtown Toronto and kudos to all the adventurers who stumble upon this bookstore on their own without the help of the internetz or a GPS. It's located inside the 401 Richmond building, which has mini art galleries inside, a cafe and a tiny music museum. The interior inside is very pretty so while you make a trip to Swipe, embrace the sounds of the squeaking floors and the feel of the building.

This bookstore has a lot of books (not just design books), toys, stationary items and cute unique boutique-like items within the store.

The last time I was at Rico's was close to 20 years ago, and I can confirm other reviewers' comments that it hasn't been updated (ever?).  Really, that's too bad, because if the atmosphere matched up with the surroundings, it'd make a nice restaurant with a good reputation even better.

We started with the zucchini - yes, you've got to have it if you go to Rico's!  For my main plate, I had a special, swordfish, with spinach on the side - the markup for the spinach side was insane -- another $7?  That's like a whole box of spinach at Restaurant Depot!  And with the prices, the fact that salad is not included borders on unacceptable.  I had creme caramel for dessert - which was not very good, also outdated, and saturated with caramel like someone had too much fun with their squeeze bottle back in the kitchen.

Service was very attentive, even as it filled up over the course of the evening - I'd either show up kind of early or make reservations to make sure to get a table with views of the trees and not the internal room with no views.

Overall, I think that Rico's is coasting on its reputation instead of doing anything innovative, creative or interesting.  Updated food with slightly more reasonable prices would make me go back, and keep coming back, but for the time being, I wouldn't.",1,0,1

The outside grounds were clean and well maintained but it had a constant, awful, sewage smell that is gag-inducing.  There was nowhere outside that you could run to to escape from it.  I hope this would be fixed as it was a serious detriment to my overall experience.

My immediate family were the first ones there before they opened and parking was easy and plentiful.  When we left a little past 11am, the parking was considerably busier and I would expect it to be worse as the day goes on.

The tickets alone for all of the family, 8 adults and 2 children, set us back a total of nearly $350.  This experience is definitely not cheap, and even more so if you eat at their restaurant and buy souvenirs.

The inside was clean and well-maintained but was quite dark the majority of the time.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  If you ever wanted to know about a particular creature or one of the exhibits, a staff member will be happy to talk to you about it.  I found the ones I interacted with to be knowledgeable and took great interest in all of the wildlife they had.  

Please be aware that you will have absolutely no reception while inside.  If you have a large group, it would be wise to coordinate meet ups if people get separated or just stay together.  My family got separated from the others and after walking the entirety of the aquarium, we could not find them and ended up leaving sooner than planned.  I was not able to call\/text because of the no reception.  Don't let this happen to you!

My family did enjoy this experience but sadly, I don't think I would be returning... or return anytime soon at least.  I was expecting more bang for my dollar and there are parts of the aquarium that were still unfinished.

Now, the bad:  for some reason, no one seems to have noticed the INCREDIBLY LOUD PLUMBING in this place.  I was staying in one of the rooms that had a view of the lake and whenever one of the three neighboring bathrooms would turn on their water, it would make more noise than my alarm clock.  The view was quite nice, but since I'm here for a job interview, I care more about sleep than scenery.  

To the hotel's credit, when I called the front desk at 11:30pm b\/c I couldn't take it anymore, the fellow at the desk came right up to take me to a new room, helped carry my bags over, and refused a tip.  He was really quite courteous and friendly.  Without the exceptional service, I'd give this an Eeks!  

Still, if you stay here and want primarily to be able to sleep, I recommend asking for a street-view room instead of a lake-view room.  You will have fewer shared walls and the adjacent rooms will be more likely to be empty so you will sleep better. 

Also, I have the same weird skin thing from the water...it might just be that I'm not used to the low humidity here, but I'd expect that to show up as chapped lips first.  My legs and shins are all itchy and scratchy...kinda weird.

That doesn't mean that he is without his charm!
As I might have mentioned elsewhere, I recently went through some body changes and needed to find some new duds (to me at least...remember, this is a ""resale"" store). Carin thinks it's time for me to trade up from my current new age Jethro Bodine look to something a bit more ""man about town"".
The Beautiful Carin loves Sisters Closet and told me that I needed to take a look at the men's stuff there, as well as going to my buddies at At Ease, so I did and I have. 
The first time I was ever in this store, a couple of years ago, they were selling, among other things, used underwear...I'm sorry, but that just creeped me out!
This time, no underwear for sale, so I didn't get that tingle in the back of my neck that tells me to get out!!!
I did find a pretty good selection, including an entire section devoted to used Tommy Bahama (only in Scottsdale:) ).
They have a nice selection of sport coats, slacks, golf shirts, high end jeans, etc. Nothing really special, but if you look around, you will see something that's got appeal. I found a great Tommy Hawaiian shirt, retail $220, for $20.
All the prices here are similar.

The wait for 6 people was around 30 minutes, which is to be expected since at the time they didn't have their yelp up yet and we didn't know how to put in a reservation.

I'm definitely going to go back and try their ramen at some point but for the time being, I'm looking forward to what this new Sushi\/Izakaya\/Ramen place can do for the Green Street food scene. So I'm optimistic in my rating (I'd say I'm hovering at a 3.5 stars but since you can't do halves, they get a 4 for now.)

Atmosphere:
The inside looks basically exactly like Spicy Tang did but with a few additions (namely some cute Japanese banners near the sushi bar area.) It's pretty, clean, comfy, and a bit more trendy then some of the other places on Green St.
-Kinda small
-Trendy decor (it's mostly red on the inside)
-Cute little Japanese decorations
-Booths and tables are kinda small\/cramped

Food:
-Miso soup is pretty watery
-Presentation is a bit sloppy
-The eel roll I had was pretty good
-Prices are pretty consistent with Green St food prices and what you get is very similar to what you get at Sushi Rock
-They don't have ramen yet, and that's what I'm most looking forward to since Koto Ramen closed
-The bento boxes had pretty good portions

Service:
Considering that this was their soft opening, I'm pretty impressed. There were a few hiccups in the service. The hostess was a big overwhelmed and the servers would both take orders from a table.
-Disorganized, but pretty good for a soft opening
-Service was prompt and the staff was pretty friendly

Tl;dr: This place definitely has promise and I'm looking forward to what they're like when soft opening ends and they get into the swing of things! :) I may have overrated them but I took into consideration that they were so new. I'll update my review after I try it again!",4,0,1

Their food is okay, some of it is a hit, our ""go to's"" when we come to the restaurant, but we've tried an overwhelmingly large number of things that have been ""ok."" They're not bad, but they also aren't quite that satisfying - nor do they hate that ""ahh"" spot. I will say THIS though, at the York Blvd location in Richmond Hill, we have never failed to have bad service thus far. Although wait times have been long, every waiter and waitress that we've had has been very courteous, always ready to make suggestions and always very polite and good at their job - and I'm grateful for that.

Our go-to's that we love: burrata ($14.27); osso bucco bites ($12.97); pesto pollo fettucine (L - $19.33). The burrata and osso bucco bites are wooonderful. The truffle cream is evident in the burrata, it is a bit pricey but for fresh mozz, I ain't complainin'. The osso bucco bites are one of our favs, meaty pork bites, come off the bone so easily and into our mouths. We like the pesto pollo, but when we get it, it's tasted slightly different every time. But overall, one of the pastas we like the most above the other ones.

Tried and are meh but not bad: bomba burrata ($16.27); charity bread - great cause, but fairly salty; caprese ($15.37) - decent caprese salad; italian burger ($16.77) - it was good, the burger was well made, but it's weird that it was on focaccia bread; baked penne carbonara ($17.27) - small portion and only decent; sophia pizza ($16.87) - meh; smoked bacon & egg ($15.96) - actually pretty good, not as heavy as it would seem; mario ($17.37) - solid classic pizza.",0,0,0

Then another lady came over a told people to wait in the line we were waiting in, so here 30 people stood in front of us, because it was so disorganized.

The food was subpar at best. 
 $65 for 2 was not worth it at all. All you can drink champagne, Bloody Mary, or mimosas. If you can only find your server. 

I did like the french toast and my husband like the asian spare ribs and duck ravioli. I must say that my biggest disappointment was in the flavorless desserts. When you look at the pictures your mouth waters.  They do look like they would be delicious.

The first time I stayed here was 6 years ago and I had a great visit so when I found myself back in Phoenix I knew exactly where I would stay.  I am sad to say that my experience this time was horrible.  

I got to the hotel around 8;30 pm and still had to eat and had work to do.  I got to my room and I started sweating.  It was 100 degrees outside and even hotter in the room.  I called down to the front desk and got the response that there are dials on the air conditioning I can turn it up.  When I asked to speak to the manager he said there wasn't a manager there.  His solution was to have me follow a bell man from room to room until I found one that would work for me.  I immediately hung up the phone and went to the front desk.

At the front desk I talked to a woman who got the manager right away.  I explained the situation and told him that I was going to dinner and that when I returned I expected my luggage in a room that was at a habitable temperature. 

My room was changed and the air conditioner did work in the new room but my experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  I understand that the guy I talked to was very young (it was the same guy that checked me in) but there are major training issues here. 

The second issue that I faced was that I was charged $26.80 after I checked out for the mini bar.  I never touched the mini bar!  (I did have free Waldorf Astoria branded water coupons of which I did take and I did leave the coupon for). Are you kidding me? It was a good thing I went online and checked the bill they posted which is something that I never do but this hotel was just off. I got the same manager that helped me with my room issue.  He said he would reverse the charges. No apology. 

The third thing that happened is I accidentally left the do not disturb sign on the door so I had to call housekeeping to have my room made up. I was in the room while the housekeepers were there.  I was working on my computer and making phone calls since and no one came on the first phone call I made to housekeeping.  The second call an hour and a half later after I returned from lunch is what brought someone to my room.  I asked for an extra bag of coffee which they gave me. I also asked for extra lotion since my skin was not used to the hot dry Arizona weather.  They went to the cart and said they didn't have anymore.  Sorry.  I literary looked at them like they were at another planet.  They went to walk away and I said, ""You don't have any in the entire hotel?"" To which one of the ladies replied we'll have to go get it and stared at me.  OK was my response.  When she returned she handed over one little bottle of lotion to which I thanked her.

I was very surprised with my experience here.  I would have gotten better service at any of the other Hilton Brands.  This is not the way the Hilton runs hotels and I sincerely hope they can turn this hotel around.  The Waldorf Astoria properties are among my favorite and to see this happen is horrible.

ATMOSPHERE: Big dining room, and with a number of smaller private dining rooms with sunken seating to provide a different experience. 

I love the hilarious cat posters where a cat is dressed up in Japanese costume and scenarios. Complete random, but entertaining.

SERVICE: Good service. Very accommodating to our group of 5 people. Since it was a Saturday afternoon, it had steady flow of diners, and so sometimes the service was not as quick, but overall very receptive to requests & needs.

PRICE: Average. As expected for such a bubble tea restaurant.

FOOD: I agree with the other reviews that their sushi pizza, and rolls are good. The sushi pizza, unexpectedly, has a lot of avocado on it - which was a nice surprise. It made for a great mix of textures - which is what I like in a sushi pizza.

For rolls, we had the Lobster Roll (it tasted good but couldn't really taste the lobster well...) and the Giant Dragon Roll (the better of the 2 rolls for sure). I'd like to come back and try the other rolls!

We also got two another appetizers: the grilled calamari and the kalbi. I didn't get to sample the kalbi (it only had 3 pieces and there were 5 of us), but the grilled calamari was great! Highly recommend that calamari: the texture was nice (dense but not too chewy) and had a tasty teriyaki sauce. The portion was also fair.

And finally, we shared the medium sashimi platter\/boat. It had all the standard fish on it. Everything was good. Not amazing like Hinote or other fancier places in Toronto. But I'd choose this place over other Mississauga options like Sushi Tei.

This is super close to a frequent destination - so I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu!",2,0,1

Everything about this is super fun and it's definitely a great place to go with friends. I do feel that the price is a bit too high though but I guess it's worth it if you're able to afford it. I did notice there were a lot more highschooler's and college students versus adults but that didn't bother me one bit.

It was hard to go in without expectations because of the rave reviews written everywhere, and I must say - don't worry about that at all! This place is great. From the very friendly hosts, to the server in the lounge who took the time to recommend a cocktail, to the lovely touch of a complimentary glass of ice wine from their social media manager, this place takes care of the details.
We took advantage of the Summerlicious menu and were so happy with the choices we made. We started with PEI oysters with a very nice mignonette, scallop cerviche (delicious!) and King Oyster mushroom gnocchi (which made its way to the top 5 best dishes I have ever eaten.) The entrée of beef striploin was cooked perfectly and was accompanied by a potato gratin with boar bacon... need I say more?

Went in this AM to try to find my wife some flowers for her birthday, stopped to ask employee who was restocking shelves if they carried flowers. The employee looked at me, ignored me, and continued stocking the shelves. This interaction is fairly representative of all the encounters I've had in this store. Employees are rude, unhelpful and frequently give a lot of attitude if asked to do anything for a customer. Shoppers are slow, obnoxious, and frequently hold up lines arguing with cashiers about the prices of items. I've seen several families get into loud screaming matches in the middle of the store over what to buy for groceries.Cashiers don't help the matter, as they scan and bag items as slowly as they possibly can, and make what should be a five minute trip into a twenty minute ordeal. This is also the only giant eagle I've ever been to that doesn't sell beer. The liquor store around the corner employs equally rude individuals and has a very heavy police presence, probably to prevent shoplifting.

The few cucumbers that were left were deformed and bruised. All the strawberries looked brown and the pre-packaged fruits were expiring right before my eyes. The pre-packaged lettuce had like 2 days before it's expiration and was turning brown. You know that section they have in all stores where the stuff is like 75% off or whatever cause it expires that day? That was the quality of all the produce except they were still charging full price. Like does anyone even check to make sure the items are of sellable quality? It certainly didn't seem like it.

It looked dark from the outside so we didn't know if the place was open when we came around 1PM. Fortunately, the place opens at noon so we were in the clear (surprised it's not open earlier in the weekend). However, given that we were the only customers for quite some time before a bigger group of people came around 2PM. 

I tried the Strawberry Lemonade Sorbet but wasn't quite a fan of it, so instead I went for their signature Strawberry Blonde combo (and I wanted it without graham crackers but the store clerk put it in anyways.)

Overall, the ice cream didn't wow me as much as I would've hoped, and it was already melting before I even started eating it. Also the the strawberries were frozen and hard to chew on. Additionally, we got it in the waffle bowl container and noticed that it was a shallow bowl, so there really wasn't a lot of ice cream (about a scoop mixed with other toppings). 

Even though, we used a buy one, get one free coupon, the total came out to be over $7, again quite pricey for a scoop of ice cream. I'm not sure how often we'll make our way over for ice cream here, might just pass and get desserts elsewhere.",0,0,0

But still, there are a lot of reasons why it only deserves a three star rating from me. For a five-star hotel you would expect to have all the amenities in the hotel room, however, that is simply not the case. The hotel requires you to call in a request for all amenities such as utensils, cups, toiletries and they didn't even have a pen in the room.  I understand that they probably do this because they want you to tip the staff every time they deliver an amenity, but when you're booking a five-star hotel you would expect everything to be provided for you. Also I didn't like the elevator arrangements because if you booked two different rooms and one room happens to be on a different level than the other, there's a huge likelihood that you won't be able to take the same elevator to the other room, but instead you would actually have to go all the way to the lobby or to the ice room or to the pool in order to switch elevators. I booked a room on the 49th floor but my friend stayed on the 56 floor, when I asked a staff member which elevator was the most convenient way to get to my friend's room, the staff member had no idea. 
Also there's only one restaurant (not open 24 hours) so if you wanted to order food you have to order from room service ($27 for a regular burger--the Trump burger...which wasn't even cooked right).

I first found this gem in Chicago, loved it! Such cute clothes and inexpensive. Come to find out you cannot order online, thus my hopes were crushed. Traveling back and forth to Chicago all the time will then make the clothes a bit out of my price range. Then I discovered the store in Vegas, much closer, but small and not fun, and 6 hour drive to go shopping is a little silly too. 

So, I finally made it into the one in North Scottsdale, its big, but not nearly the size of the 3 story store in Chicago. Big enough though. I have had several successful finds and at great prices; a pair of plaid pants $10, black dress $24.95, scarf $7.95, long chain necklace $5.95, big comfy sweater $20, an adorable dress for my friend's 2 year old $9.95.... you get it. It s also in a great location, walking distance to my work, easy parking, and near a bunch of other shops at Kierland. 

However, what I do not like about this place..... those who work in the store are your atypical Scottsdale brats just looking for a discount it seems. None of them smile, no one has ever (5+ visits) asked if I need help with anything, they bark at you when you are in line for the dressing room ""I need you to form a curved line!!!"" Yikes! And there is this crazy beeping alarm that is always going off, I mean really fix that thing already. Geez! It's called customer service people, be nice! Smile for crying out loud. 

I am anxiously awaiting the opening of the H&M in the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall, hopefully they are nicer there and I will not have to frequent the North Scottsdale one anymore.

I am referring to the absence of edible lobster in the Lobster Mac & Cheese ($14) that I ordered as part of our $150+ meal for two. There were exactly 4 tiny pieces of cartilage from the claw-point of the lobster (I always discard this part when I eat lobster) and it seems that they throw that crap in there to trick customers into thinking there's actually lobster in the dish. Even more maddening is flipping through the channels in our room upstairs and stopping on 'MLife TV' to watch Hubert Keller himself describe the 'most comforting American food' being his signature Lobster Mac & Cheese - he then chops up an entire lobster tail and tosses it in his mac & cheese skillet.

The Onion Soup ($6) was oddly thick and tasted really bad-for-you like it was made with lots of butter. The Crab & Avocado Sphere ($9) was pretty good, but it would be pretty hard to mess that up (chilled jumbo lump crab and avocado slices.) 

The Branzino ($29) fish was about a 5-ounce portion and sat atop an inedible mound of salty and sour ""risotto"" barley with some random chorizo sauce that made it worse. The Kushi Oysters ($9) were much smaller than the awesome ones we got at Sensi a week earlier, and the shuckers at Fleur get an F for leaving bits of top shell shavings in with the oyster, ruining two of the oysters.

If you must go to Fleur, do NOT sit on the patio like we did. The dueling piano bar entertainment 50 yards away is really hard on the ears in more ways than one. We endured a 7-minute version of ""Barbie World"" and the electric pianos they use sound like 100 decibel cell phone ringtones. The water fountain around the corner only adds to the chaos.

Anyways, people seem to love this restaurant, but I don't get it. I would be totally down with $50-$70 per person at a tapas-style place if the food was good. Unfortunately it isn't. I can honestly say I wouldn't eat at Fleur again even if it were free.",7,5,4

I went with siblings and my aunt here on Sunday night. We were seated the minute we had walked in the restaurant. First off our server seemed like she had not wanted to be there and was very flustered, I don't know why seeing as they weren't extremely busy. Whenever they had brought out our salad and bread sticks the salad was fine, but the bread sticks were very tough, like they were stale. I had ordered the Chicken & Gnocchi Soup, what I always get. It all tasted fine except the Gnocchi had a gummy aftertaste. I had ordered the Seafood Alfredo and my aunt had ordered the regular Alfredo because she's a vegetarian. Her Alfredo had basically no Alfredo Sauce! It was dry and she asked for a side of more sauce. My Seafood Alfredo had a very weird flavor and it had a very strong fish taste, because of the scallops, which I ignored. But, almost every scallop tasted sandy, like they weren't cleaned well. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of the dessert, and it was amazing. We had all split the Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake and it was divine. All in all a good place, just had a bad experience for once. But, if service continues like this I won't be a customer here for much longer.",0,0,0

My husband likes to occasionally stop and get pizza here because of the convenient location between his work and our home, and quite honestly because Pizzazz takes credit cards and Geracis requires cash on hand. The last time we ordered pizzas from Pizzazz, they were both watery: the topping layer would immediately slide off of the dough base leaving you with one big bite of toppings and many bites of boring, soggy dough. We also had fried provolone which smelled and tasted like it had burnt plastic in it and the cheese was dense unless eaten quickly while sizzling hot. I wouldn't let my toddler eat it for fear of choking and not understanding the harsh smell- although my husband and I both tried some and we're fine.

You get the option of a soda or 2 baby egg rolls. I opted for the 2 egg rolls and burned my fingers on them. They were pretty standard with cabbage inside. The noodles were a little bit chewy to the tooth and flavorful. I would have liked them to be a little more spicy. There wasn't enough burn or kick to make me sweat.

Went to this spa today with a few friends.

I have a problem with the taller male twink in particular. He has no manners in how he treats people and at one point, me and my friend were the only ones there, speaking quietly, and guess what? He goes up to us and says ""shhhh"" for like the 40th time.

We made a reservation the day before not knowing how busy they would be but upon arrival there was really no reason for a reservation.

The Atmosphere\/Decor of this restaurant is really nice, the lighting was perfect also. If anyone remembers Mardi Gras the Willow is leaps and bounds nicer.

We were promptly seated upstairs and the whole Dinner there were only two other tables eating. Most of the other customers were outside. It was nice and quiet and very nice, a great place to take a date or significant other.

As for the service there were no issues. Our server Victoria was really nice and prompt. She explained everything to us and you could tell she was there for a while. (Turned out she has been there from the beginning) She  forgot to get me a Beer refill and was nice enough to offer it for half off without me saying everything. Overall a great experience.

The food. No complaints. The bread was really good. Beef Stew was awesome, Filet was also really good (Marrow was a great touch), Potatoes were okay, nothing special. I passed on the greens, do not care for them. Wife said the salad was good and the main course, Cranberry Chicken was awesome. She also said the Mixed Drink was really good.

The only reason for the three stars was the price. A few drinks and dinner for two came to almost 90$. The experience was really great I'm just not sure it was worth that much. I will probably return in the future but the Willow would not be a regular place, only for special occasions.",1,0,0

Their milkshake menu is so misleading! On the menu: ""Oreo marshmallow-Cookies & cream ice cream and Oreos topped with marshmallows, whipped cream, and Oreo crumble"" What you actually get is a cookies & cream milk shake without any toppings...And I asked them about it and they said to receive the toppings was an extra $1 upgrade. They did give me the toppings for free because I asked about it...but clarity would be nice because the item description should include everything listed for that set price.

Yes, the price tag is high versus going to say a Dunkin Donuts or your local coffee shop for ho-hum sweet stuff.  Gaby et Jules dishes out high quality desserts with ornate decorations that could double as works of art.  I visited Pittsburgh for a week and dropped in at least three times to sample several of their treasures.

First of all, none of these desserts should be transported and left in a hot car or left unrefrigerated.  The creme, gels, and filllings will melt down and you'll be sad to have spent your hard earned dollars on a small colorful puddle; treat them as though they are ice cream servings.  The macarons can keep longer but they too should be eaten when cool to experience the outer shell crunch and soft, inner layer of subtle flavors.

So, my selections consisted of:

1) Le Croustillant Aux 3 Chocolats - basically a combination of three different chocolates that are smooth like mousse with hints of hazelnut, and less sweet than your average chocolate milk.  Unbelievably delicious.

2) La Jolousie - soft texture, perfect blend of Bavarian creme, strawberry gel, mint panna cotta layered on a Madeleine crust with a touch of almond.  Dessert wet dream has just occurred!! 

3) Bavarois - at first glance, a red velvet cake?  Nope, the fruit custard top and what I imagine is close to an airy pound cake as its base.  Good, but not my favorite.

4) Apricot and panna cotta swirl cup - not the actual name but it describes exactly what it is.  An apricot gelee and panna cotta mix never gets too sweet and hits a home run for me on the third visit.  The plastic spoon easy breaks through the layers and the two flavors are an ideal match.  It is so light that even when you are too full for dessert, it will still fit in your belly.

I have had pretty much the same dishes at a fraction of the cost in other Japanese style restaurants. Its like £6 starter, £9-12 for a main & the pricey drinks... doesn't sound like too much but considering this is a chain & you can go to much better independent restaurants for about the same price, seems a bit like a rip off?

We have been working with Pillar for over a year. My son started out with just occupational and speech therapy. Everything was great for about the full year, we had both therapies back to back Saturday mornings. My son is 8 and has school and 15 hours of behavioral therapy elsewhere during the week, which makes our availability limited, so Saturdays were a great option. The place was always clean, all the staff was friendly, even on the phone. The girl up front, Sarah, was so great.
Then the owner and our insurance starting making changes and honestly the place has gone to downhill. A couple months ago my insurance decided to change their policy for therapy sessions that only a licensed person can do the therapy sessions with my son instead of the certified assistants. As a result, the therapist we were working with could no longer work with him and that meant that the day and time slot we had was no longer available. When they notified me, I immediately asked her to comb the scheduled for both offices (Ahwatukee and Mesa) to find something that works for us. Regina was the one I talked to who originally gave us Friday at 4pm option so we took it. The second session we had was cancelled by them just 2 HOURS prior to the appt time because the therapist was not in-which is very unprofessional. This was a huge issue because I initially got a voicemail from Regina who spoke low and fast and I didn't understand any of it except ""cancelled today"" and something about scheduling. When I called back she was unavailable and asked the girl on the phone if she could tell me what the voicemail was about because I couldn't hear it and I think our session was cancelled. She ""looked in the notes"" and told me yes our session was cancelled that day. I asked her if there was anything else because there was more on the voicemail I could not hear and she said no. 
 The next Friday my son showed up with his grandfather and was sent away because he did not have an appt. He notified me and I was confused because no one had called to cancel with me. I called and again spoke to Regina. She said that I was informed the week prior that that therapist was no longer available to work with my son. I insisted that I was NOT told that he was removed from the appt time. She immediately got attitude with me and said I was told in a voicemail the week before and it was all in the notes. I explained how I couldn't understand it and had to call back and the other girl didn't tell me that but she didn't care so I had to speak to her supervisor. 
 They had nothing for afternoons and Saturdays weren't an option either. How can they not have any afternoon or Saturday appointments? Even though we have an odd schedule, there are 4 days a week where we have afternoon time we can meet. During the summer, we had added feeding therapy and that appt was soon to end because school started soon and we needed to move that appt as well. She explained that the company was making a lot of changes and moving all therapists around to a new schedule, plus they lost some employees but were in the process of hiring new ones. So basically, your owner decided to completely change the schedules of all therapists (knowing they work with autistic clients who HATE change) without warning? In addition to that, my own insurance has made changes at the same time literally leaving us between a rock and a hard place. So I had to grin and bear it and be on the wait list....
Literally the following week, we had yet another issue. Now I share custody with his dad and his grandma on that side dropped him off. While I was waiting to pick him up, I asked the girl (not Sarah who I haven't seen in a while and think she left) to look and see if any availability had opened up. During that time, I realized he should've been done by then, so I asked where he was at and she told me he was in occupational therapy session. I was confused because remember, he's on a waiting list... It turns out that when grandma dropped him off that morning, they asked her if she wanted him to stay later and have occupational too with the same therapist since they had an opening. The issue is; 1) she doesn't have the authority to make that decision, 2) she did NOT tell me or his dad about it, and 3) she doesn't even know English or what she agreed to. Why?! Why would you ask someone who clearly doesn't know English and not call the parent? I was livid! I pulled him out because I had to get to work, but that was the last straw for me. So since we are still on a wait list, we are actively pursuing other facilities. My advice? Don't waste your time with this place. I overheard someone else in the lobby complain about a similar issue while I was there last week, so its not just us. They clearly need to get their shit straight and I don't see it happening any time soon.",1,0,0

Start: The blueberry mint fiz drink was not fizzy and not refreshing as we had expected. The warm bread was nice. The salad appetizer was bland - mixed greens with very little dressing. 
The entree - artichoke and ricotta ravioli was salty and nothing special - about 4 or 5 medium squares, with a few peas, carrot slices and pickled artichoke which tasted weird; the only highlight on the plate were the mushrooms. 
As a dessert lover, this was the most disappointing - the melon was a combination of honeydew melon water with some crushed ice, watermelon and cantaloupe. It was a big disappointment. The cheese plate was ok and the pastry one was ridiculously small and it looked like the dish had been sitting out for a while. The brushed chocolate was dry. 
The service was good. However, it took long to get our entree.

We had reservations for ten for a big family dinner and they were well accommodating and the waitress was a real doll. I would say that with our group of ten it didn't seem like they could fit that many more as the place was small but not claustrophobic more cozy and quaint 

My wife and I ordered the Calamari that had a really great dipping sauce however the calamari was over cooked and had a burnt taste to it. We also ordered the ""special"" soup of the day which was a cream of potato soup that was for lack of a better term god-awful. It was very starchy and had no flavor.

The menu really lack in variety and there were not a lot of choices which would be okay had the prices been a bit more variable.

The entrees were good but they were not very large and not really worth the price of the meal. I had the Norwegian Salmon which had a great flavor and the potatoes were delicious but the fish was a little tough and over cooked.

My wife had the seafood trio that came with a crab cake, a piece of salmon and a piece of trout. The crab cake was not very tasty and the two other pieces of fish were very small in comparison.

It was quite similar to the uptown Night Market when it was located behind Metro Square. Street vendors selling  the traditional Asian street food fare, basketball games going on, live music and dance performances being performed on the main stage. One of the bigger differences was the T&T Waterfront Night Market had an area of rides for children which unfortunately were not free. The T&T Waterfront Night Market had a lot more families with strollers attending and less young teenagers unlike the uptown Night It Up. Also, they were showing Asian movies at night that were part of the Reel Asian Film Festival.

It's gets quite crowded and is shoulder to shoulder in most places which is not unusual for most Asian festivals but I think part of the reason is because there are quite a few strollers that slow down the walk through traffic. As it gets busier as it gets darker. The lineup for the food stalls move pretty quickly (10 minutes or less) with the exception of the food vendors selling stinky tofu which can be quite long.

Here is a list of food I tried:

T&T Food Stall:
BBQ lobster ($10 for half a grilled lobster): This was probably my food highlight of the night.
BBQ Scallops and mussels ($9 as a combo): Just average nothing special.
Shrimp Tornado Roll ($4 a roll): This is essentially shrimp tempura covered in batter that resembles a tornado, this was not bad but the batter was fried a little too much.

Thai Food Stall:
Oyster Omelette Pad Thai ($7): Kind of bland and nothing comparable to Sukothai's pad thai.

Taiwan Dessert Stall:
Bao Bing ($4): This is a popular Taiwanese dessert which is essentially shaved ice with fresh strawberries and mango covered in condensed milk, this was delicious, it had a fair amount of fruit that was fresh and ripe.

There was a fair amount of parking with a large parking lot across the street from the T&T Waterfront Night Market that charged only $5, there was also free street parking but finding a spot was pretty difficult.

There was also a fair amount of portables to accommodate the crowd with water sinks and hand soap and hand sanitizer just outside the portables which was a nice touch.",2,0,0

I've always come as a kid and now in my 20's, I just have great memories of this place and the food and menu hasn't changed a whole lot. 
Their classic meat sauce spaghetti is a winner. Pasta is always cooked just right, al dente. Sauce is so hearty with a hint of sweetness, surely a popular staple of this eatery as you can even buy jars of it to cook at home. You get a discount towards this purchase after your meal.

I've only ever tried their spaghetti which is so good I never had the desire for anything else. I love that they provide bibs on request. You can slurp all the noodles you want and not worry about making a mess.
I've gotten cesar salads with my meal and they're always generous with the sauce, which I love, it's nice and garlic-y.

This is one of the rare restaurants that actually serves Jello or rice pudding for dessert, although it is not on the menu, loyal customers over the years will know this is a trademark.

Their spicy dishes are spicy.  We've got a high spice tolerance (when in India we order spiciness ""as the chef would prepare for himself""), but I found a 2-star to be definitively spicy and enjoyable.  A 3-star might have been too much.  Be warned.

The fries...instead of salted they are spicy! Spicy and incredible...but then you add the sweetened ketchup! HOLY FRIES BATMAN! Looks like there is some brown sugar in the ketchup, making the spiciness of the fries POP!
The pulled pork has a very distinct smoky flavor...some mesquite...but not overwhelming...they definitely cut it with some other wood keeping it not overpowering, but almost perfect. You could see the bark even though it was pulled. And the spices! Not too spiced that you couldn't taste the meat, but great flavor. It didn't need sauce, but added some sweet hot bbq sauce after the first bite. I was in heaven! This was perfect pulled pork.
The brisket was perfectly smoked with no need for sauce at all. Good bark, great seasoning, not too dry....OMG this is great brisket.
Now the ribs. They were smoked to perfection and covered in a sweet smoky sauce ( not the spicy one). They were almost fall off the bone, but not quite. The meat was reconstituted and...and...perfect. This was a perfect BBQ rib.
So between the BBQ Nachos, fries, creamed corn, pulled pork, and brisket, I'd say this was an amazing BBQ Joint. But then you add the ribs. When I say they were perfect, I do know what I am talking about. This is the BEST BBQ JOINT in Arizona! I can't wait to come back!

I had an Americano and a lemon tart, both of which were delicious. The lemon tart came on a pastry shell instead of the shortbread crust I usually find (and use when I bake myself), but it was still pretty good. I found the food a tad expensive, but I'm not a native Torontonian so I'm not sure how it compares to other cafes in the city. Service was fast and friendly. All around a good experience!",0,0,0

Eduardo is one of the few people who responded to me via e-mail (I'm not a phone person), and was able to quickly schedule an estimate appointment. He showed up promptly, and took notes on my extensive list of items (tree trimming, remove a small palm, weed removals, palm trimming, bush trimming, removal of old landscape materials, irrigation repair). Once we were done, he sent me an estimate via email VERY shortly after. The price seemed great to me, so I scheduled for a few days later.

The crew showed up close to the window and got straight to work. It was about 3-4 hours of work, and when they left I was completely happy with what they did. The MANY weeds we had were all gone, grass mowed and edged, and all the bushes\/plants looked healthy again. I was only planning to have them do the one time cleanup and have them back maybe 2-3 times a year, but I'm considering every month or two now!

Oh, and after the work was done an invoice was emailed to me. I can't tell you how much I appreciate a company embracing technology (I'm a bit of a IT nerd). I like to be able to shoot off an email late at night when I'm getting my personal to-do list done, and KO accommodates me perfectly. They called later that day and took my payment over the phone.

I had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good, but the second time was a hot mess. It looked like a five year old did my nails for me. I went home and took the polish off. But this is the kicker:
I couldn't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by, so I decided to give it a try (obviously the nail girl wouldn't be doing my hair). I went in and sat down the a woman with an Eastern European accent  came to talk with me. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples....none of which looked like my picture, but I always assume the hair dressers know what's best. Now, you're all thinking, ""..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour..."" right? 
Nope, she told me she couldn't do my hair because I had lice! Of course I freaked out. Another hair dresser came over to see if I was alright and I was mortified. She asked if I had experienced any itching. I said no. This hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it wasn't too bad yet, but original hairdresser said it was really, really bad. I freaked out and left (obviously without having anything done) and went to a Shoppers and bought lice shampoo. I went home and had my husband look at my hair. He looked and looked and could find nothing. I still didn't want to take chances, so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and I went to a walk-in clinic. The doctor looked at my head and ALSO said there was nothing there! 
Since I was paranoid, I still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest I went to examine it. But even with my husband and mother looking at my head, we never found a single thing. We didn't even see dandruff!! I went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful...but dry at the ends...yeah, because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo! Thanks a lot you crazy woman!
So ultimately, I never had lice. I don't know if this woman just decided she didn't feel like doing my hair, or if she was delusional, but I sure won't be going back there EVER again. No one else should either, unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced.",7,9,0

First off the name of this franchise in chinese translates to 'Fat Cow Noodles' with a picture of a fat cow. However the english name that is displayed is ""Pho Vietnamese Delight"". Always a big pet peeve of mine when it comes to chinese vs english names for businesses.

This place is no where near authentic viet but the food is still good. The portion sizes are massive and you do get your bank for your buck. A small pho is almost like a medium-large. Can you imagine what their large is like? I'm a big eater but I can barely finish a small on its own. The broth is flavorful and not fatty like other places such as XeLua and Pho88. However the broth also is a bit different then genuine pho. There's something about it that makes you want more. You WILL be thirsty afterwards as they over power your meal with MSG.  The other dishes such as rice or vermicelli dishes are as well very good. Portion sizes are big for those too.

Service wise, they are crap. Like all their franchise locations, they follow the stereotypical chinese\/mainland service with rudeness, dirtyness and greedy for cash. Like for example, i do not appreciate having my table wiped clean with the same cloth used to wipe the food\/soup that was spilled on the floor. I do not like to be moved to another table midway through my meal to accommodate a larger group. I also do not like the bill served to me when i'm still eating to hint that i need to go to accommodate others. I also do not like to be told that the amount on the bill is before tax and tip although i'm still taking out cash from a different pocket to accommodate the tax and tip. Oh and the greatest one yet, having their server speak to you in mandarin but realize you do not understand them so they make some snarly remark. I questioned ""pardon me""?... he gives me the ""argh"" and shoves me back. 

All of the above has happen in multiple occasions but why do I come back? Well it is because it's the closest pho place near my work and the broth is good. Otherwise I would never come back.

Would I recommend this place? Yes but ONLY if you drop your standards.",8,1,1

The not so good.. it's friggin small. From the moment you walk in, it feels like you're stuck in a fully occupied office elevator. Long stairs up (not handicap accessible whatsoever unfortunately) lead you to a decently sized waiting\/bar area. Until a show lets out and you literally become a sardine in a can. The theatre itself, also small BUT it works. Arrive early to your show and stand in line to get priority seating and you won't be disappointed.

In Markham I was able to enjoy a dish of this history in a cute establishment. 

With a decent menu I was able to understand that they has some decent choices.  I like things spicy so I made sure I was enjoying a hot bowl of spicy chicken ramen.

The portion is decent for lunch and there is a good amount of meat in the bowl. 

It was a good dish. Very unique in flavour and I enjoyed the noodles. The experience was worth the stop but it did not blow me away.

We were already anxious to begin with since this was the first time we will be leaving our dogs to a daycare, and this place was ""highly recommended"" so we picked it. Wrong move. My rottweiler stunk of urine and had poop on his coat when he was picked up and also had sores on his paws from stepping on some cleaning material or bleach.

I asked them to groom her and my specific instructions were ""just a trim around the body and face, but dont trim the ears and tail."" When we got her, she was almost shaved bald, just left about 1\/2 inch of hair!! I assumed they cut her hair all the way through because her hair was so matted since she was never brushed. How I came to that conclusion is because her ears were not trimmed and there was unbrushed, matted hair everywhere!

First of all, I must tell you that this salon is NOT associated with the Hilton resort. It is quite a bit down the road in a strip mall and only a family name. When I arrived, I was greeted by a heavyset woman wearing a dress that barely covered her butt. She is very unprofessional and seems unconcerned with me as a customer. I wait about 15 min and than asked if I wanted something to drink. I asked for some water and was given a small cup (why not bottled water?). I was never introduced to my stylist. I believe she may have said about ten words in the time I was in her seat. I asked for Carmel color highlights and she convinced me I wanted blond (I don't think they offer any other color!). I am a redhead so I was a little hesitant, but I went ahead and went along. After all, when she said highlights I was thinking small streaks. As she begins doing highlights she is taking layers of hair instead of small strands and I am getting a bit worried. The stylist Maria seemed cold and our communication wasn't   very good. English wasn't  her first language. Over the time I was in the salon, I felt like I was in the middle of a reality show with the red neck manicurist yelling across the salon and constant arguments between staff the stylists. None of the stylists are dressed in the manner that you would expect professional people to be dressed. A stylist who appears to be the owner berated the front desk person and the front desk person yelled back at her and went to the front desk in tears. There is constant yelling in the salon between stylists.  I have to almost yell to get the stylist attention after the blow dryer went off.

You can use your phone for the interactive parts but it will drain 50% of whatever phone you use with the app. So instead of using your phone you can rent an iPod for $5. We rented ONE, but got zero use out of it. I thought it was one of those talking devices that tell you about each station. The guy at the counter was really vague. The app\/iPod you make a profile by filling out information and taking a picture of yourself. After that you get a bunch of multiple choice questions. You can use their device to take pictures, but at the end they charge you for those pictures. 

They do let you talk as many pictures as you want while you are there. I suggest you bring your own camera. It really isn't for adults unless you are really, REALLY into the Avengers. Tickets were 34.99 per adult with a 20% local ID discount and $5 rental fee for iPod.  

I do not think it was worth the money. Maybe if they gave away a picture at the end it would make it a little better. They were charging $20 for one picture. I am really pissed they charged me for a device I never got... If you do decide to see this attraction please remember to check your receipt!",2,0,0

- It's got multiple cafeterias and Tim Horton's, Second Cup and a well-kept gift store.
- There are large and visible signs everywhere
- The main entrance has a modern and welcoming feel unlike any other hospital.
- The hospital has all the capability to do all sort of tests in house which speeds up the process.
- There's a hidden bar in the basement! (don't get too excited though... your only way into this extremely exclusive bar is via one of the resident veterans!)

I used to do work on those Tsoynamis! I am not vegan, but I have an egg allergy, which makes eating dessert hard sometimes :'(

Green holds a special place in my heart because it was the first place I ever ate dinner at in Arizona. When I moved to Arizona my mom (who also has an egg allergy) came out to look at apartments with me. We were staying around the corner at the Holiday Inn in Old Town, where they recommended we eat at Green for vegan food. We then returned every day for either lunch or dinner for the remainder of our trip. Once I arrived in Arizona I used to get Green at least once a week, generally as take out. Everything is delicious, not really super healthy for the most part but I can deal with that when I am eating vegan food sometimes! I also don't think that is the goal here, I believe Green is taking a vegan twist on comfort foods and they do it well. I used to get a Coffee Tsoynami and the Calexico Burger--so good, but you'll need a siesta afterwards.

I personally prefer when not a lot of meat substitutes are used in vegan food, which is the only reason why I am giving Green 4 instead of 5 stars. Most dishes use a meat substitute like seitan or tofu, though I'm sure you can avoid this by ordering something else with beans for example. I feel sad I never went to Nami in my time out in Phoenix and when I visit next I will need to try their food out too in addition to returning to Green!",2,0,0

All-in-all, I was incredibly happy with every part of their class-- the instructor was awesome, very upbeat and encouraging. The other other program facilitator was also great at helping everyone get set up.  

The nice think about Artists Uncorkd is also a little bit of a draw back: they do not have a set studio, but rather set aside areas of local bars.  So unfortunately, the music was pretty loud (and undesirable), so there were times when the people at the far end of the table couldn't hear as well.  If I could make one suggestion, I would say to move the tables so more people have a view of the teacher and can hear and see better.  Granted, that may have been the bar's doing...

I believe when I called they said the minimum group size was 8 people, so if you're able to get a group together, I highly recommend using artists uncorkd-- no group deposit (unlike other companies in the area), we were able to choose our own drawing, and we had a little bit of flexibility in terms of what bar we chose to hold our event at.

For food I had an omelette and chocolate chip pancake. The chocolate chip pancake was the best thing here and was loaded with chocolate chips inside and out. One on the side was a great deal and a good splurge from my attempting to avoid sugar. On the other hand, the omelette was just average. There were a decent portion of ingredients but it seemed kinda sloppily cooked and the eggs weren't fluffy but had too much of a burnt crispy texture. The side of potatoes was too oily for my taste and unfortunately a lot of oil seeped over to the side of fruit. While the portions are generous, I'd rather have quality over quantity.

The aestheticians that I have worked with( about 6 of them) over the past 6 months have been professional and listen to what I wanted. I am very simple- upper lip and sometimes eyebrows. No real way to mess up the mustache, but my eyebrows are precious since they don't grow as quickly now that I am in my 40s. I get a little worried because the gals that work there have  such a varied eyebrow look-from really thick and dark, to thin and penciled in- I make sure to let them know to only clean up the strays and not to take off a lot of hairs. They have been good at doing what I ask. 
I am in and out within 5 mins. They have engaged in small talk which is nice to distract from the discomfort. 
My gripe is with the front desk. They are so cold, and uninviting, and just rude. When you are checking in or out and another customer comes in or calls-- they will abruptly stop working with you and address the other customer without asking you to ""wait one minute"" or ""can you hold please?""

The waitress is named Kitty. She is sweet as sin. She's not terribly fast but she is terribly nice. She makes sweeps through  the dining room with a push cart, dropping off tea and soup in large batches.

We showed up right at the tail end of six tables all being seated at once. Plus two other tables sat down after us. Honestly, my first suspicion was that this meal would be a suckfest, it would take forever, and the service would be awful. I was pleasantly surprised.

We ordered some chow mein and this shrimp dish. Plus we got soup, egg rolls and tea. Kitty took turns through the dining room. First she brought everyone tea. Then came our soup. And finally the egg rolls. My girlfriend said the wonton soup was the best she had ever eaten. I commented that she says that every time she gets wonton soup. This soup was tasty, don't get me wrong. But it was nothing special. You got two chubby little wontons and some pieces of char siu. It was quite good for 85 cents. The egg rolls were pretty ordinary, too. They had decent sized shrimps in them.

For the entrees, the chow mein we got was delicious. The sauce was a simple brown sauce. There was ALOT of beef in it. The beef had a rich, beefy taste and wasn't tough. In addition to the beef, there was tons of celery in it. All in all, quite tasty. The portion wasn't very huge...but neither was the price.

The shrimp dish was pretty much in the same brown sauce. I forget the name of the dish but I think it was like Va Que Shrimp or something. The restaurant prides itself on Cantonese specialties. This was one of them. Its basically several fresh veggies in a brown sauce with several fried shrimp added at the end. Much like the chow mein, it was simple. It was a small portion but, again, the price was small, too.

This is one of the things I like the best about this place: the price! This place is super cheap! We ordered two entrees, soup, tea and egg rolls and it was $16! This is amazing. And you'd think the food would be gross or the service would be shit....but not here....

The portions are smaller because the price is smaller. This might make some people upset but to me this means two people can try three things or a family of four can try five or six things. The quality doesn't suffer, either.

The only complaints is that they neither had a high chair or a booster seat for our 2 year old. Also, they do not take credit.

I mean I went on a Saturday and always myself there the very next day, its just addicting. Three out of the 4 times I've been I've sat at the bar, and the bartender, is great.  He's always got suggestions, tells what he likes, his fav's what he's had and hasn't had and why.  He's even got suggestions on the very cool all day (10:30-7pm) happy hour drinks on the Saturday\/Sunday menu.  What a deal!!

The food I've had is outstanding.  One thing I'll never forget is the butterfish, that was melt in your mouth delicious!  The wasabi mashed potatoes was not what I thought they would be so at first I was disappointed.  I expected them to be spicy and creamy, but then I sat and thought about it again, and said wait, these are exactly what they should be, Mashed potatoes infused with wasabi, kind of like cucumber water.  I believe I just had the wrong idea to begin with.  The seaweed salad is a great starter, a huge portion and tastes like seaweed salad.  This was my pre-Brunch visit.

So this past weekend I tried the Brunch.  Saturday's visit was later in the day and I'm not much of a breakfast person, so I went with the Fish taco.  Another fish done well, perfectly done and seasoned.  Much to my surprise they give a little bit of what appears to be homemade salsa, that goes with it and is yummy, i found myself trying to figure out exactly what was in it so I could go home and duplicate.  My boyfriend had the pork taco's, and I really enjoyed the pork flavor.  I was expecting greenchilli ish type flavor, but it was very sweet barbequey.  The black beans and rice aren't anything special, but not gross either.  Then Sunday I tried the Ahi Eggs benedict.  I was so scared, as I said I'm not a huge breakfast fan.  It was awesome.  Very very good flavor.  It got cold real fast, but that's my experience with eggs..

- chips\/salsa not that good
- food is only average

Tonight I ordered the chimichangas. Instead of one big one, you get two smaller ones. Since you get two and your choice of chicken or beef, I asked for one of each. 

They brought my platter, and after I took a bite of beans I noticed our waitress hovering over me with another platter. She explained that ""this one"" had one of each, and that she was going to take the one they gave me and ""just throw it away."" 

A waste, because it wasn't really that big of a deal if they'd brought me two of the same; there was no price difference and I wasn't dead set on having one of each. 

As it turns out, I think they had originally given me what I asked for and took it away, because my replacement plate was two chicken chimis*. Food trashed for no reason, and potentially the correct order (or they plated it incorrectly, twice). 

*Their idea of chimichangas are really just bigger-than-average flautas; they were open-ended and have no filling aside from the meat. They also offer flautas, I wonder if they're just the same thing.

Other blips in service:
- served everyone but one person at the table, and took forever to finally bring them their food (soup)
- we had three kids with our group, and their parents explained they were going to split a meal between the three of them; the waitress didn't bring any extra plates, so we made ""plates"" out of napkins

Maintenance staff is very friendly and Rob the manager I think is the only office staff member who does what he can to make the residents happy. I had one staff lady look at my husband when he went in to complain say ""what do you want me to do about it?"" and another tell me ""why don't you come to the office and prove it to me""! No joke sooo UNPROFESSIONAL!!  However, I have lived in nicer apartments for less and they will completely rob you here. Not at all worth the money. My husband's vehicle was broken into 3 months into living here. Every new neighbor after us had their vehicle broken into shortly after they moved in. The office staff did nothing!! We don't have security here (Like they say they do.. I saw them probably twice the whole 2 years I've lived here) and they don't care! They leave the front gates open most of the time, which doesn't help the robbery that is happening. 2 days living here I got yelled at by the office because I put in to many work orders. Like what?? With one of the orders it took them 6 months to change.. Window screens (which were bent up and broken, all but one), then had the nerve to just flip them instead of replacing them because they thought I was talking about the inside blinds. Wait what?? Still did nothing to those! They have a horrible bug problem and when you ask them to spray, they make it worse! (Ended up going to lowes and investing in my own spray that works.. haven't had a problem since). The walls are super thin can hear everyone all the time. Luckily our neighbors keep the peace!  The office never answer their phones and if you ask then to call you back or they say they will, they never do! I would sit out in front of the office if I could and warn anyone who is looking for a place to live to run fast, but unfortunately I can't do that! I highly recommend NOT giving this place any of your money!!  As I look forward to moving out! I recommend renting a house. With that you can atleast get your moneys worth and you are basically paying more than a house here!!",2,1,1

I started the afternoon with a body scrub and facial, followed by a massage. The scrub was ok, but could have been more complete - when I got home I noticed patches on my legs and sides that were clearly missed by the therapist. 

Next was my facial - also done by the same therapist - probably the best facial I've ever had! My skin felt soft, fresh and renewed. No lingering greasiness and the perfect amount of moisture. To top it off, the skin in my face felt tighter and completely rejuvenated. 

Last was my massage - sadly, nothing to write home about. The massage therapist was a male, which didn't bother me, but I was expecting more of a massage-type treatment, instead of simple mobilizations of my joints and energy \/ breath work and a very light petting type massage. I wish he had gotten into my muscles more - even after asking for more pressure, the therapist continued his routine. The treatment was relaxing, but could have been more therapeutic.

It was like being in a Mexican shrine for Day of the Dead, including skeleton-themed fabric headrests on the booths.  So cool!  As a Mexicophile, I truly appreciated the ambience, as well as the latin music - heavy on the Mexican, but with some Shakira and cumbia thrown in.  I couldn't stop dancing, even before the Riesling I had to go with my meal.  

Our waiter didn't seem to know much about the menu, but he was helped along by Vernesa, who did.  I ordered the taco platter, choosing the chicken mole, marinated pork, and the fish.  Two of the three were winners:  the chicken mole taco was outstanding and the pork was very good.  The fish wasn't.  I could have ordered it grilled, but took Vernesa's suggestion and went with the default - fried.  There was almost no fish in that taco, and the pitiful amount turned out to be breading rather than fish.  The Veracruz coleslaw that was the taco-mate of the fish was tasteless.  I didn't complain about it until I was asked, and I'm very disappointed that not only wasn't it comped, I was still charged the ""seafood surcharge."" Only 50 cents, but I think that if a customer says there was no fish in the fish taco, management shouldn't add insult to injury by charging more.

My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas.  It was a picture-perfect, beautiful plate of food, and he enjoyed it.  Our friend had a pork burrito and liked that, too.  We all loved the plate of chips, guac, and fresh pico de gallo we were served at the beginning.  Those chips might be the best I've ever had!

I found the alcohol surprisingly pricey, not across the board, but for some of the offerings.  The bar seems to be a work in progress and opened after the restaurant did.  The bartender brought me a taste of the one Riesling they had, a label I'd never heard of - 14 Hands.  Terrific, and not overpriced.

All of the staff were so friendly that it was a pleasure.  Had it not been for my fish taco experience and, at the end, me being greatly insulted by our waiter in his inept attempt to be friendly (and I'm still upset), this would have been a 5-star review.",11,8,8

Some of the staffs here are absolutely rude and is only trying to scam you. My friends and I recently turned 21 so we decided to go clubbing because that's what basically everyone does in Vegas. I looked on Yelp and found a ""promoter"" named ""Kenny Lo"" who said he could get in 4 girls for free in the expedited line and would get unlimited drinks throughout the night while my 2 guys would have to pay $40 but will get 1 free drink. We arrived there before 11 and were able to get in to the pool area perfectly through the guest list line. However along the way, since it was my first time, while we were going through the line, the manager wanted to stamp my hand and I told him I was already stamped. He then told me ok and to proceed on. I then walked a few feet and looked at the complimentary drink card that I got and said out loud ""only 1 free drink?"". I said this out of confusion because I was told by Kenny Lo that we would get unlimited drinks. I then turned back to ask my 3 other girl friends who were trying to get the 3rd stamp and one of the staffs heard me and told the manager to not give me another stamp just because I said ""only 1 free drink?"" I think it's completely stupid that he agreed to not give me a stamp just because I said something that I was confused about. Is it so wrong for me to voice my concerns? And the fact that the manager did not give my 3 other friends the 3rd stamp too just because I said that I have my hand stamped already is completely bullshit. My friends did not even say anything but sorry that I did not know and he still did not want to give us the stamp. I don't see what I or we did wrong for him to deny us the last stamp. What kind of FUCKEN manager is he? I was told by one of the staffs inside the hotel that the manager for this club is a douchebag and I absolutely agree. I asked many girls who were outside in the pool area and they were also cheated for not receiving a 3rd stamp which also prevented them from entering the nightclub. We then proceeded to make our way inside of the clubbing pool area and waited in line for about 1.5 hours outside trying to get inside the club only to find out later that we actually needed the 3rd stamp to get in. We went back to the line we were at before to ask the manager about it and he responded by being a complete dick. He said he tried multiple times to give me the last stamp, but that's bullshit. He only tried ONCE and just because I told him I already had 2 stamps, he decided to not tell me that I actually need 3 to get into the nightclub and the only way to get in now was to pay $40. This manager is rude and needs to be fired. How the hell is he even a manager?! His behavior and attitude is disgusting and awful. 2 of my girl friends decided to pay the $40 and had to go to the reentry line to get in. I however, decided to wait because I had to go find my other girl friend who was saving our spot in the line of the pool area. When I found her, the guest list line closed and we were no longer able to pay the $40 to get in. We then walked around to see what we could do about it and I spotted Kenny and stopped him. I told him my situation and also told him that my guys actually paid $100 instead of $40 to get in and he said he would find someone to see what he could do about it. We followed after him until we were stopped outside of the entrance and decided to wait for him outside. He texted me and told me he would get back to me in a few and he NEVER did. I messaged him multiple times and called him and he still didn' respond. What kind of promoter is he? DO NOT TRUST HIM. He will not help you in any way. Even IF he did try to help me and was not able to find a solution, he did not bother to even tell me and just ran away missing..that is just so foolish of him. This Kenny Lo guy is a phony. My friend and I ended up wasting 4 hours trying to get into this damn club and couldn't just because of the damn ass douchebag of a manager and SOME of the staffs here and of course, the useless promoter Kenny Lo.",3,1,1

He calls with a two hour window in the morning (normal, fine) then doesn't show for the appointment-calls 15 minutes after the window to tell me that he's going to be late ""another hour and a half at least"" I said I needed to reschedule.

The food: all of our steaks (4)were dry as a bone.  I am not sure if they were overcooked or if it was the salt rub on them or both, but they were really dry.  I ordered rare, but the steak i got was medium at best.  I sent it back and received a new steak that was maybe medium rare, but still not right.  At this point i decide to just eat it.   I expect so much more from a steak house, and even at the $100 for two deal i would not eat here again.

The service:  Its as though we didn't exist.  It took a while before i could get the waitress' attention and send back my steak.

Manager offered us coffee on the house because we were at the table for 10 minutes without having been greeted by our server. Another manager came by after a while and asked if she could take our order or if we just wanted to wait on our server (why would that even be a consideration?). 

My food was okay - comparable to IHOP. My friend asked for well done hash browns - they were turned inside out, so the part that might have been crispy at one point was being steamed, making them mushy and there was barely any meat in her omelette. Had to flag down a server for coffee after being there half an hour. And then they charged us for the coffee anyways. 

Overall, I'm just really disappointed I picked this place. I'm fine with an okay breakfast food at a chain restaurant. It's kind of expected, but the customer service needs a lot of work. A manager should have taken the table over or sent a server over immediately. And realistically during peak hours, somebody should be walking the room every 10 minutes for basic refills (water, coffee, etc).

The place is trying really hard to be different and doing in a way that all looks the same.

Beer list was overpriced and awful.  I'm OK with that though, because they had a good list of mixed drinks.  Cheap beer in cans at a large markup or crafted cocktails.  That is what this place does and I don't mind paying for a cocktail.  Except most of the cocktails tasted were just too sweet or not really well balanced.  Also, while I get trying to keep up with that whole mason jar retro thing that used to be interesting - if you are hand crafting cocktails then you should put some care into how you serve them.  Glassware makes a difference.

Another thing that makes a difference is having bartenders that actually seem like they care to take your drink order - I just couldn't find one and it's a huge part of the reason why we left.  Our group went 3 rounds and each one took forever.  Not only to get the bartenders attention when you are pretty much the only one there waiting, but to have them actually made.

Another reason for leaving was that the seating was flat out uncomfortable.  Again, I get the vintage project feel they were going for.  It just isn't enjoyable.  There is a reason why those designs were left rust.  

The parking, as mentioned by many others, is awful.

It was nice sitting outside.  It was a very open space.  If you enjoy dancing there was a large area for it with people actually dancing.  Although poorly executed there is potential to have a decent cocktail scene.  There is a pretty diverse scene there.

However, so much of that space brings no function to actually enhancing what I want when going out for drinks with friends.

A gift shop with other novelties - yeah, no.

A boxing ring? - I love boxing, but pointless other than to say that you have a boxing ring.

Ping Pong, cornhole, etc?  Sure - I've been known to play at bars that have these things - just not that many options to play for such a large space and watching strangers play games isn't exactly as fun as playing yourself.

That weird retro kitchen art type installation - again, why?

The place can get away with a lot of these space wasters, because they have so much space and it's easy to just walk past to find what you do want.  

However, for what I would want - a comfortable place with tasty drinks and good service that is easy to interface with - this place fails.

I came in a couple times and each time they were out of the matcha beignets. I finally snagged an order this weekend. They are ok. No matcha flavor, actually no flavor whatsoever until you soak them in the powders and honey. After a good soaking they taste ok. It's just sweet fried dough. 

Customer service is nice as I have never had Winter melon and I wanted a sample. They made me a small sample and I loved it. It has a maple syrup FAINT coffee type taste. Apparently it is made from a certain fruit called white gourd. It is quite addicting. 
Mango smoothie also good, sweetened with honey.

The outside is cool, the architecture is real neat, but the place is confusing when you see Beyonce in here but not Britney Spears, then we asked and they told us Beyonce donated money so that's why shes there. Like WTF Beyonce? in the rock and roll hall of fame? Cmon now...

I guess since I hate rock and roll this won't come as a surprise but yeah I'd rather go walk down a beach then to ever come back here, it was cool to see guitars and all the history and memorabilia of artists and Lady Gagas meat suit. Also being so close to Katy Perry's lollipop spinney suit was the highlight of the trip.

I just thought this museum would offer more ""Rock & Roll"" type stuff, it's mostly 40's through the 90's Rock and Roll stuff, I think if they added a section of new stuff it would make it a lot more popular, and for being the price it is to get in it's almost ridiculous. You add these millionaires to this museum, at least let there rich asses cover the cost of entry.. So if you go, maybe just check out my photos and sit in the lobby because it'll save you a lot of wasted time. But if you love classic rock you will probably love this place.",3,5,4

I was in the mood for some authentic Mexican food and was craving something reallt south of the border and found myself at Mi Covina.  This little gem of a restaurant serves up Latin American specialties from Ecuador, Peru and Argentina. 

The restaurant is small and unassuming. The restaurant was busy the afternoon we dines and a wait for our entrees to arrive however, we didn't complain.

The entrees at Mi Cocina are fresh and natural tasting. The ingredients are simple, but complex in flavor. The entrees are unlike your typical Mexican food restaurant loaded with cheese or heavy sauces. These aren't rays of light, flavorful, and absolutely delicious.

On this visit we had tacos, gorditas, enchiladas, and and Sushi Estillo Sinaloa, and everything was delicious to the very last bite and the Agua Frescas we're so refreshing, light, and flavorful.

I've been here a few times. A couple times for dinner, and a couple times just for dessert.

Everything is fantastic. Try the fried chicken wings, the smashed chicken and any of their soups. All are delicious and amazing. For dessert, the lychee ice cream with mochi is nice. Also the shaved ice is fantastic.

The menu is mostly Hong Kong style with a few variations. Everything is prepared fresh, and if you want something that isn't on the menu, just ask for Wendy, the owner. She is super nice and friendly.

I really do love this place and would recommend it to anyone looking for chinese food.

Well she wasnt... the first ladies i spoke to were great n said u cannot tell without surgery if the procedure was done or not. (Probably why there is a clause saying you wont let the cat outside.

As I was leaving another patient stopped me and told me how horrible these ladies are and that lady in particular, Tiffany, is so good at treating patients like crap.

I had seen it before, but didn't know anything about it. I was hungry, I was passing by and I decided to go in. I looked at the menu and I figured the best decision was a chicken tender meal. I think it was $7.99 before the coupon. 

I went to go get a drink and looked around. One really amazing thing is the sink by the drinks. Sinks can get pretty nasty and I was happy to see that it was SPOTLESS and didn't have water underneath it. The drink area was also spotless. I feel the need to mention that since at many fast food places the drink area is atrocious. 

After I settled into a booth, I looked around. It's bright, clean and unlike most fast food (or fast casual) places, there are televisions. My food was brought to me rather quickly, so I didn't expect it to be good. I am a Raising Cane's fan and I would have a hard time saying which is better. I have no clue what people are talking about with the fries because they were so good, I finished them before all of my tenders. My visit was only about two weeks ago, so I don't know about the fry change. The ones I had were perfect. The chicken was just the right mix of crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I am very particular with my fried chicken since I only eat it at Cane's, CFA and Blue Ribbon Chicken (I eat one of those once a month). Otherwise, I only eat grilled chicken. 

I am not one for sauces. If food is good you don't need to top it with sauce. I didn't put anything on these tenders. Any sauce should complement the food, not mask it. And the food should not NEED the sauce. I dip my Cane's into their sauce, but I don't drown it. And I use the sauce because its ridiculously good. I love honey on my chicken, so the next time I come here I'll try that. I read some of the other reviews, and it's great to know the rest of the month when I am eating clean I can come here as well.",0,0,0

This is not a traditional Korean food restaurant but rather a Korean fusion restaurant. We knew this but just fyi as name alone can mislead. 
It's a family style food joint and small portions are more than enough for 4.  The restaurants interior is rustic looking and pretty cool (5\/5). Service was great (5\/5) and he helped us with ordering.   We ordered quite a bit: Kim bop with  bulgogi that was a favorite (5\/5); kimchee fries were very good (5\/5); sirracha crackling were decent (4\/5); kimchee pork spare ribs, I was disappointed with these, they looked odd and the flavor just wasn't good (1\/5); sweet potato birds nest was thin sliced and deep fried with honey and cinnamon (4\/5); kimchee pork tacos (5\/5); bulgogi taco (5\/5); fried pork belly drew mixed reviews and were so so imo (3\/5).

We all had the tasting menu ($60) with the wine ($35). The wine portions were generous. However the quality of the wine was not good. 

For starters we'd a tuna tartar which contained ginger and sesame sauce. The ginger was too over powering and the tartar had too much avocados. The pairing for this was a Riesling which was good. 

The second course was a risotto with a wine from Alsace France. The risotto was ok and a bit salty. Nothing special. The wine was horrible. It tasted like flat soda that left a burning sensation in my throat. Kinda like drinking scotch with flat ginger ale. We told the waiter and he confirmed that the wine was off without saying it. He compensated us with a glass of Chardonnay which was ok. The waiter also gave us an extra glass to compensate for the poor wine. This is the reason why he was a good server.

The third course was a Chilean Seabass with black beans. Seabass is a very delicate fish and should never be paired with beans or anything with rough texture. This is a horrible combination. To top it off, the seabass tasted like it was frozen. The fish was not delicate at all. Why did I know this?  I was at Ocean's up in Scottsdale the night before and had a real Chilean Sea bass. This dish was so bad I completely do not recalled what the wine was...

The final course was a petit filet which they cannot possibly screw up. It was tender but nothing special. I believe it came with a Cab which was ok. 

Given the amount of feedback we've provided to the server and one of our friends didn't like the chocolate cake in the prix fix menu as a dessert, the server gave us a sampler of desserts and a port to end the evening. Desserts were so so and so was the port. However, the server made a genuine effort to satisfy our needs.

This area of the country used to be a hub for quality furniture, built with craftsmanship and designed to last long enough to pass down to your children.
IKEA represents everything that furniture has become: sawdust and glue pressed into cold geometric shapes and coated with 3 choices of laminate.  

It's not that I dislike modern furniture.  And I certainly have to commend IKEA's founders on a brilliant business model, ($37 for a full bedroom set?!  WOW!)  But in addition to the fact that a room filled with IKEA furniture resembles a screenshot from an 8bit video game, it's all completely disposable.

And my rash is going away. Maybe I'll be calling the Az med board next for the lack of med care received here. They are looking out for a quick buck!

Just an update, I have to pay around $90 for this mistake of coming here. But it's well worth paying and to know what kind of place this is, one who won't listen.   I ended up using coconut oil for my arm rash and I'm rash free.",8,2,2

I grabbed breakfast here and had the original breakfast burrito... this bitch comes with scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon, sausage, ham and cheese. I asked for it without the ham because three meats would've been gluttonous! :P 

I grabbed some mountain dew for the caffine I needed to get through this day, and good mercy! When I saw this huge monstrosity - I wished I asked for it without the sausage too! but I managed! Good and freshly cooked, but when I was ordering I saw the cooks cook up large orders of hashbrowns and there weren't that many people there. Soooo they pre-cook some of their stuff with. I think I was fortunate to have been there early... but if you're going to come later in the morning - I unno... things might not be that fresh. I loved my burrito but it was a LOT of food!

This place is horrible. The people here have no idea how to communicate to each other about their customers. 

Once waited on hold for 25 minutes. Hung up, called back and was simply replied with oh I forgot I'm sorry. you can tell they really care about their customers.



I was supposed to have two different jobs done here and both never got fulfilled due to LACK OF COMMUNICATION. I was always talking to different people who I had to fill in the issues on my car, no communication.. again. Was told ""I won't be here tomorrow but my manager will give you a call"" would never receive a call, would call the store and have to again repeat what was happening to my car. I was never in a rush to get things done on my car which I guess was my fault, because when time was an issue they said it was too late and they couldn't have the part for me in time, excuse me? I've given more than enough time... but like I said lack of communication seems to be a huge key in this place.

I got a salami sandwich (not on the menu), and the bread was good. The sandwich was small, though, by deli standards. A person with a bigger appetite would have been sad. I ordered a horseradish mayo that didn't have much flavor, and the onion slices that came with the sandwich were threadbare.

Decided to give it a try and when we called to make a reservation like we do at any other Brazilian steak house the gent that took the reservation sounded as if he didn't understand why we needed a reservation. When we pulled up to a half empty parking lot we soon discovered the restaurant had only 1 other table seated for dinner.  There were 3 staff members a seater\/water boy a waiter and the chef who graciously came out to our table with a ball cap on after I complained that the meat tasted old. He assured me that the meat was indeed fresh that he had just served it to the other guests and they loved it. Told me I could come in his kitchen and see he just opened the ""BAG"" of meat that morning. Besides the point that meat doesn't come in a bag I should have took my first clue with the very sparse and brown might I add salad bar.  They had the light so dim you couldn't see what u were grabbing. With good reason to because you didn't ""want"" to see what u were grabbing. Moving on to the hot over simmered dried up hot bar that was suspect too. Not to mention apparently the guy serving the dried old meat off of skewers was only on his second day of serving which would probably explain why on earth he was using a knife with the sharpness of a butter knife to cut the meat and he had to keep slicing and slicing just to Butcher the meat and barely give a sampling. Needless to say after the chef came out to ""loudly beg my pardon"" regarding the old meat I told him he c o you take his meal a shove it. After 5 bites I walked out with my family in tow still hungry and none the less richer because I refused to pay for shitty service and food. Did I happened to mention the chef came out to my car to further argue with me about how fresh his meat is and how clean his kitchen is. He even offered a tour.

I went with a group of 5 on a Friday night, we were seated with 15mins but the table was a little crowded after all our food came. I recommend coming in multiples of 2 for a better experience.
We ordered noodles in the curry, original, tomato and spicy soup. It was a very fun experience that was like suedo hot pot - you are given a boiling pot of soup with some semi-raw toppings and bottomless noodles. You can opt to have additional meats or seafood in the original soup.
We also ordered the spicy lung and tripe, as well as squid tentacles.
Overall, I loved the food. However, all of our soups except for the original had a funny soup pickle taste, but some of us didn't even add in the pickle topping. So the original soup was hands down the best flavour. I also don't recommend adding additional meats to the soup base, you really door need it - the toppings it comes with is plentiful. I missed out on getting more refills of the noodles because there was way too much food.
Price wise, out tab came out to $17\/person after everything, but next time I think the basic $8.99 will be plenty for your everyday meal...which is not bad considering you get unlimited noodles.
I highly recommend, but most note that you will smell like a round of hot pot after you leave.",0,0,0

I'm on a bit of a budget so I can't afford to come to places like this often, but wow.  You get your money's worth here.  I can't say if the food is authentic or not because I've never been to Thailand, but I know it's a hell of a lot better than Thai Express.  The ambience is rather hectic, as this place seems to get quite busy.  There's a pull up bar and a ton of seats.  There's even an area with pillows and a low table for what I'm assuming is ""traditional"" style Thai eating?  The service was alright.  I could tell the servers were busy and didn't really have time to chat, but they weren't rude either.  The food is where this place really shines.  I ordered the Khao Soi and my date ordered the green curry.  Both blew our socks off.  Not from spice, but from flavour.  I could have eaten that khao soi all day long until I died from rapid stomach expansion.  My date's green curry was served inside a coconut, which was pretty neat.

Was going to check out the new green tea Japanese ice cream place on a weekend, but due to the ridiculous line up, my friend JC suggested to walk to Roselle instead.  Yes it was a LONG walk on a rather chilly day, but I really enjoyed the scenery on my way to this cafe including this furniture place we dropped by!

First thing I noticed about this place is the red bench outside the cafe, which is perfect for summer time!  Once you walk in, you have 4 two people table for the small seated area and that's it.  The rest is all coffee and sweet!

Since we already had a big meal from Miku, we ordered the Earl Grey Soft serve with Lemon Sorbet inside, French Coffee and the Banana Éclair.

The Earl Grey soft serve was amazing, but I didn't really like the sorbet inside, so if you can, ask them to skip the sorbet, just have the ice cream!!

French Coffee was HUGE, which can serve 2 full cups with no problem.  I had the coffee black and surprisingly, the coffee was pretty smooth and I really enjoyed it black, plus black coffee is perfect when you pair it with desserts!

The best of this visit was the Banana Éclair!  Just looking at it already made me drool and once I had the first bite, OMG, it was so amazing!!  The dough was so soft, amount of cream was just right and the banana flavoring was amazing considering I am not a big banana person.  It was so good I got one extra Éclair for takeout so my parents can try also!

Overall, I love this little spot, great clean environment (all white), great coffee, great desserts and a great place to spend some quality time with a friend.

P.S. I wish I can give this place a 6 stars. 1 extra star for my guest JC for making the experience THAT much better and memorable.. =)",3,0,2

He got back to me right away and pledged to come by the house in Henderson on Friday.  None of the other landscapers I contacted even returned my calls!  The job was to landscape the home of a deceased relative so the estate could be settled and the house could be sold.  The yard was a complete wreck and had not been touched in at least a year, probably longer.  There was overgrowth and dead vegetation everywhere.  

Rich came by at the promised time and took a look around.  He gave me what I considered a very reasonable quote for the job.  Rich worked quickly and efficiently, doing the job in the time promised and did not ask for extra $$$ to cover ""unexpected"" costs as some landscapers do.  He communicated well, and made sure I was informed of everything that he was going to do.  He was completely professional and paid attention to every detail that I asked about.  By the time he was done, the yard looked great.  Bottom line, Rich came through for this out-of-towner in a big way.

I'll mention the same thing everyone else has - parking is a bear. I'd recommend parking in a deck and walking. For a Sunday at 6PM, it was fairly busy. There were a number of clean tables but the wait staff still had us take a beeper and go to the bar. We got our menus and were paged before we could even open them. I would have rather waited at the hostess stand but that's okay. 

Our server was great, and brought us samples of each beer on tap. He was knowledgable about the sushi and the entire menu (which is a book in itself!). The menu is definitely a lot to take in, so if you get a chance to look it over online before coming in, it might help. There's an extensive beer selection and an emphasis on local foods, which was appreciated. I haven't ever tried the ""Burgushi"" but it's certainly tempting and interesting!

I had two rolls - a classic Philly and Miss Moffit. My dad had the Georgia, which was good but also heavy. His girlfriend had the tropical storm (I think), which sadly fell apart and wasn't anything particularly memorable. Both of my rolls were good, but not the best I've ever had. I was disappointed in the pricing. The specialty rolls are $17-19 each and classic rolls are $8-10. For two adults, two beers, and four rolls, our bill was $80.

Brooks Farms had good reviews and the photos that we found online looked decent. The website listed many activities for kids so we thought we'd give it a go.

...we were so disappointed. After a 40 minute drive, we happened upon a run down farm. The market was small. It offered canned goods (asparagus, relish, etc.) as well as maple syrup, farm eggs, pork, milk, and baked treats. As far as produce? A basket of asparagus and rhubarb. :(

Now the play area ... from what we could see behind the fenced area was a field with various stations set up, some sort of outdoor snack\/concession stand, hay, and some other stuff.

They actually have a pretty awesome beer list with lots of diversity, but I question the cleanliness of their lines a bit.

That being said, their sandwiches are GIGANTIC! And the fries are heaven. I ordered the Farmer's Market, primarily because the menu said it had goat cheese on it. I'm drawn to anything that says ""goat cheese."" The sandwich was great, and the pita it came on was delicious. But, my sandwich had feta on it... not goat cheese. Oh well.

Not only can you order funnel cakes, you can also order burgers\/sandwiches with onion rings or fries (combos). The funnel cakes are ordered like froyo - they give you the funnel cake (comes in 2 sizes) and you top it up yourself with choices of frozen yogurt (4 flavours available when I visited) and toppings that you usually find at Yogurty's or Menchies which vary from kit kat bits, almond flakes, caramel syrup, strawberries, peanut brittles, and more. You pay by weight - which isn't much - $2.00 extra on top of the $5.99 funnel cake and my toppings looked like a tiny mountain. 

My prime rib burger combo was also delicious! The patty was piping hot and juicy - the lettuce and tomato also tasted really fresh. The server didn't ask me about the toppings, otherwise I would have asked for no onions.. 

Although it was not busy at all during my visit, the staff here worked hard at keeping the place clean and tidy. They were mopping the floors, scrubbing the grills and wiping the toppings bar constantly while we sat there eating our burgers. It's good to see this establishment has hygienic values. 

Too bad they're located so far, but I will definitely be back for more delicious burgers & funnel cake! They close pretty early (9PM on Fridays & Weekends) and even earlier on weekdays.",0,0,0

I love the way my pedi turned out!! Jennifer did a great job! However, I'm only 2.5 days on my French mani, and already my nails are looking quite sad. (I'm very careful with my nails and can usually have a regular mani last a week or longer with no chipping or cracking.) Mai T. seemed to rush the whole experience, even though I was 1 of only 2 customers they had in the salon. She came at my no-chip with a dremel tool, and I'm pretty sure I have horizontal grooves in my nails now as none of them feel smooth after the mani was done (after numerous coats of polish and top coat). Even the basic shape of my nails don't look like I had a professional do them... uneven and inconsistent. I come to town several times a year, but won't be visiting this salon ever again. 

UPDATE: Yep, my fingernails lasted no longer than 3.5 days, before they looked so pathetic I needed to remove the polish... and when I did, my fears were confirmed, I have grooves in my nails from the dremel tool they used to remove my no-chip.

This last visit was not a happy occassion but you can only stand homecooked food for a certain time before you decide to go out when you visit family.

The meal itself was good, I had steak dijon well done (as requested)and my partner had the skate.  He had the soup of the day vegetarian style (very good) and I had the salade maison. 

Overall the whole meal was satisfactory including the drinks.  One note, bistros are normally small in France and in the context of Vegas, nothing is small so this one has a lot of space and its outdoor patio has the view of the dancing fountains of Bellagio.  

The service itself is exemplary except for the wait.  The salad and the soup came on a reasonable time but the entree was really a long wait.  In any restaurant, this is not excusable especially for a place not really very crowded.  When you finish the appetizer\/soup\/salad, you expect the dinner to come at an appropriate time.  Little quibble but prices should reflect overall service, food, timing and other extras.

One more thing, great warm bread and always ask for more if you are really enjoying, it will be good for your soup and waiting on the rest of the dinner.

Due to my hearing disability, going to movies was something my wife and I were never able to enjoy until the technology came out that provided the hearing impaired with a small screen which displayed the captions for the movie dialog.  Since this advancement I have been able to enjoy numerous movies with my wife, Amy Martin​!

However, tonight was an exception at Galaxy Green Valley Luxury + Theatre.  The display quit working properly 15 minutes into the movie.  I ran out got another unit, told the management what theater and seat location I was in.  They never came by to verify it was working properly.  Thirty minutes later the display went out again, and I repeated the process.  Ten minutes later, the third display failed also.  At this point, I was having trouble following the movie.  Instead of going out again, I was patiently waiting again for someone to come by and verify my unit was working.  No one showed.  Needless to say when you miss 80-90% of movie dialogue, your movie going experience is ruined.  Now...

After the movie ended, I went back out and asked for a manager.  She came up and apologized several times about the equipment failure, and offered 1 free movie pass to compensate us for our bad experience.  I asked her if she could give us 2 passes as I won't go to the movies without my wife and she had the nerve to say, ""It was only your experience that was affected."" 

Pardon me, but I'm going to call BS!  It also greatly affects my wife.  She has to sit there knowing that my movie experience is ruined, and that greatly affects her enjoyment as well.  It was a VERY insensitive thing to say.  One should never minimize the feelings of a disabled's spouse or loved ones.

When we called her out on that, she then offered us a second movie pass.  This was another step in the right direction, but refreshments are part of any movie experience.  I did not want to come back with free tickets, only to have them still make money off of us through refreshments.  We asked for either some free concessions OR the privilege of bringing our own so it would be a true complimentary experience.  She denied us this.  When I asked her if concessions were a part of a movie experience, she said, ""No they aren't.""  I am going to call BS again.  What the heck do you have a concession stand for if they are not part of the movie experience?  

In the end she said she said she would give us 4 free movie passes.  She went off to get them, and then came back with 8 free movie passes which tells me she realized how insensitve she was and wanted to make it right.

It should be worth noting that this is the 4th time we have had issues at Galaxy Green Valley Luxury + Theatre.  The first issue was when the battery died in the unit.  The last 3 times have been issues with the transmitters.  In the 10-12 times we have gone to the South Point theaters, we have had a total of ZERO issues.

The worst part of the whole event was the way the manager on duty insulted us by saying only my experience was affected.  It was short-sighted, insensitive, and just plain disrespectful.  We politely conveyed this to her, and we hope she will take this to heart and treat it as a learning experience.",1,2,1

Some of these people lack common sense, or are just outright selfish. I once had a guy who just cut me in line and completely ignored me when I told him that I was in line. Thankfully the worker saw this and told him that I should be served first. Anyway, here are some things to keep in mind when you're standing in line:

First, KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED. I don't care how cold it is outside, we all had to wait out there at some point. By you opening the door to feel a bit of the heat, you end up bringing in a gust of chilly wind into the entire bakery making everyone inside cold in the process. Don't be selfish, wait patiently like everyone else, and stand outside with the door closed. The store definitely should have a ""KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED"" sign at the front.

Second, MOVE IN. The entire bakery can fit about 10 people, so move all the way to the back and make a loop to the cash register so that more people can wait inside. Be mindful of all the people waiting outside in the cold, try to comfortably fit as many people as you can. You don't need that much space around you.

Third, KNOW YOUR ORDER before you get to the register. Honestly, it's not that hard - they only have three things on the menu. Their cheesecake is what they're famous for and what everyone is in line for, so yes, you probably should just get it. No, you cannot get items from the Matcha store in the original Uncle Tetsu, it's right next door and there's never a line there so walk over after. Google what each item is, read the description, don't ask what the ingredients are for god sakes, there are so many people behind you waiting. Just use Google, they are a fairly popular chain worldwide, you will probably find any information about them there. Or just ask another person in line, you're going to be standing with them for a while anyway, so why not befriend a stranger in the process.

Ok so now I got that out of the way, here's my actual review:

I avoided this place for a while because of the ridiculous lines, but coincidentally I had a trip booked to Japan over the summer and went to the Uncle Testu in Fukuoka to see what the fuss was about. No one there seem to know what I was talking about and once I found it in an underground train station, there was no line. In fact, there wasn't even one customer aside from me. I was still excited regardless, and after taking a bite, I think I would have to agree with the other reviewers that, ""it's not worth the wait"".

That's probably the most common response you'll hear from people. But the question is not really about whether it's worth the wait (because what kind of Japanese cheesecake is worth a one-hour wait), what if there wasn't a wait? Then would you still go get one? Then I would say yes. Japanese cheesecake is more like a sweet cheese soufflé than a New York style cheesecake that most people are used to - They're actually quite different. If you don't like the cheesecake from Uncle Tetsu, it just means you don't like Japanese cheesecake, because they're all going to more-or-less taste the same. If you do like Japanese cheesecake, then this place won't disappoint.

The line can be frustrating, but I actually think it's part of the experience. The whole absurdity of a collective group of people wasting their time lining up for a $10 cheesecake is quite a rare event. The hype likely isn't going to last forever (looking at how they're currently doing in Japan), so I don't see the problem in joining in on the hysteria to come out of it and say, ""this is it?"", to go home and write some snarky review on Yelp telling people it's not worth the wait. That whole process is the Uncle Tetsu of Toronto experience - even if it's not worth the wait, you STILL did it even after reading all the reviews telling you not to. Maybe we all want a piece of the experience more so than the cake itself.

You might think it's a good idea for them to expand to meet the demands, but the demands only exist because the supplies are low. If they expand too quickly, they'll follow the same fate as Krispy Kreme did about 10 years ago with their aggressive expansion in the GTA. That line you see is what creates the hype, so they'd want to create a line for as long as they can.

Now, it's actually possible to come at a time when there isn't a line. I live fairly close by and I've come at multiple times when I was actually the only person in the store! I've noticed that the line becomes long during the school-year, where students from Ryerson and U of T tend to conglomerate here when they have time to kill. The line was surprisingly dead during the winter holidays. But then, the cake just doesn't taste as good when you don't work for it. So just think of it this way; the longer you wait in line, the more delicious (or more disappointing) that cake is going to taste.",2,5,0

I have to say I'm underwhelmed.  So they bring out the big steak knives and I got all excited.   These things are going to be epic and large.  The size... Ehhh, smaller than I thought.  What a waste of the steak knives.  I ordered the Mr. Ho which comes with the taro buns.  I'm not sure who Mr. Ho is, but someone needs to let him know he needs to put more taro in his buns or else it just falls flat, and seriously, who wants flat buns?  I was expecting some soft buns too especially with the taro in there, major let down. I took two bites of the bun and just decided to eat the patty by itself.  The patty is flavorful but I'm not sure what sauce they have on that thing but it just ruins it.  The Chinese sausage was cut too small and were hard and just fatty.  There was no crunch in that burger at all.   We also ordered the Kiki.  It's so not memorable that I can't even comment on it.  Too much hype and a big let down.

Mike: not at those numbers. sales: I dont have a crystal ball mike where do we need to be? Mike: (really..haha) You dont need a crystal ball or sarcasm ,just a hearing aid i already told you what i needed yesterday ,about 100 times. Sales: mike,why are you doing this to me? Mike: (is this guy for real?) Sorry we couldn't get to the numbers ,ty for your time. This conversation illustrates why I bought my car at lexus of las vegas.

Well, Hotel Zero 1 is pretty centrally located. It's literally across the street from Chinatown, down the street from Place des Arts as well as downtown, and 1.5 blocks from the Metro. We're able to walk to the old ports (maybe 10 minute walk), McGill University (about a 12-15 minute walk), and the local museums. 

The hotel itself is quite modern. The rooms are small, clean and ""crisp"" looking -- think studio apartment. There is a sink, fridge, microwave, table setting for 2, and coffee maker in the room. The beds are very comfortable and the room is equipped with a lot of mirrors (there's even one IN the shower!). So, if you're inclined to be vain, then you will be in heaven. The bathrooms are on the small side -- there's barely any room to physically sit on the toilet. The showers are awesome, they could use a little extra space though (no tub in our room). 

The hotel does have wi-fi and it's by room... first time I've ever seen this. When you check in, they start the wifi for the room and you access the wifi by clicking on your room number (e.g., if you're in room 510, then you would click on ""zero1-510"" connect to wifi). It works very well in the room, but we haven't tried it outside of the room.

There is also a terrace on the 5th floor, which overlooks a small park. It's nice and comfortable, but fairly small.

For us, this hotel was perfect. Lower cost, perfect location, friendly staff, and comfortable rooms. Downside: they do have valet parking for a higher cost than self parking. So, if you don't plan to use your car, then you may want to save a few bucks and self-park. But, there is limited space to park when you check in (there's 15 minute parking right outside the hotel, but all of the spots were taken when we arrived). We ended up parking in a garage about 3 blocks away and hoofed it with our luggage -- not fun. So, weigh the pros and cons on the parking options... There are limited options for public parking that is 24 hours (some were only available for 12 hours). 

Although I would probably try a different hotel the next time I'm in Montreal -- not because Hotel Zero 1 is bad or I don't like it -- it's because I prefer variety and trying new things. I would definitely recommend the hotel for anyone on a budget and looking for something pretty central.",3,0,1

Maybe because it was we were all Asian, or maybe because we ordered in Chinese, but the waiter didn't offer to suggest anything to us or offered us forks - which I think is probably more of a positive thing.

The service was good for a Chinese restaurant, the waiters asked us if we needed white rice and served the soup for us when it came out.  We had the seafood & fish maw soup, spicy beef and scallop & veggie dish (all with white rice).  It was all very good, and reasonably priced.  I would recommend this restaurant.

The reason for only 3 star is that there was not one particular thing that popped out, when compared with other Chinese restaurant's I've been to.

The view from the balcony was amazing, but too cold for us to stay out there to hang out.

Don't come to Harrah's if you are looking for someplace fancy. But do come to Harrah's if you are looking for a place to occasionally get a few hours of sleep and store your personal belongings. 

Just a little background on my trip, I came to Vegas for a bachelorette party. I'm a Total Rewards member and frequent the Atlantic City properties so was able to get a pretty good deal on two rooms at Harrah's Las Vegas. They were able to accommodate our request to have rooms next to each other (although unfortunately not connecting). My flight home ended up getting canceled so I had to quickly rebook a room for one additional night. Since our group came at staggering times throughout the weekend and I had to come back for an extra night, I was up at the front desk a bunch handling check-ins, checkouts and then some more check-ins. The front desk staff was a pleasure each and every time I had to deal with them. They were courteous, pleasant and professional. This is consistent from the Harrah's in Atlantic City and every other Total Rewards property I've ever stayed at. 

The casino floor itself seemed like a maize at times. Finally before I was ready to fly back east I got the lay of the land. Again it was nothing fancy, but it had the standard slots and games that you would want to play at a casino. While the restaurant selection wasn't huge, it was impressive that they had a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse on property. The Harrah's Cafe was the only late night food option on premise, but I guess it was better than nothing. 

The two rooms booked for the group, were decently sized and clean. There were a few issues with my room upon check in, but with a quick call to housekeeping and everything was handled. The last person in the room locked the safe shut and we didn't have a full set of bath products. No biggie. It also turned out that the TV in my room wouldn't turn on, but I figured we really wouldn't be in the room much for it to be worth it for them to fix it. It did mean that we couldn't check out in the room though. As others have noted, the walls were pretty thin and you could hear laughing and toilet flushing from nearby rooms. 

My biggest issue was with my room during my unplanned extra night. The door to my room (Carnival 627) did not fully close by itself. I received a phone call at 3:30 in the morning from Chris at security telling me that the police were outside my door and that my door was open. Luckily the door was dead bolted so no one was able to get in but that was really scary. I urge everyone to push the door until they know it's fully shut. Usually hotel doors just slam closed in a heart beat, so it's not something I'm used to doing. Apparently there is a security team that goes around making sure everyones door was shut. Since the walls were so thin in my previous room, I figured any time there was any sort of sound from the door, it was from another room. Apparently it was just mine being shaken in and out. Thank you again, deadbolt.

So my experience does seem more like a 2.5 or 2 experience than a 3 but ultimately it comes back to my original points: clean and location. When I return I'll be sure to make sure my door is securely shut and to expect to hear my neighbors, for those few moments I'm not living it up in Sin City.",9,2,2

I just don't know why, but any buffet that is North of the strip just isn't up to par at all.  And the Medley at Aliante is no exception.  First of all, at breakfast and lunch (not including weekends and holidays) there is virtually no line.  Great if you're hungry and can't wait to eat something.  The service staff seems to be really good and their personalities are really good.

That is basically the good part, with a few exceptions.  One of the first things you see upon entering is the huge soup and salad bar, with the fruit prominently displayed.  It looks awful.  All the melons are cut in different sizes and looks worse than if my 6 year old grandkid got hold of a knife and started cutting.  The tables and booths are of decent size and comfort.  Usually go to buffets at lunch, as that is my big meal of the day.  Went for some soup and tried the minestrone.  The flavor was ok, but the pieces of vegetables were much bigger than the spoon.  The salad bar itself seemed stocked with the usual ingredients but no bell peppers.   Everything down to the prepared salads seemed to be prepackaged.  Went over to the Mexican section which had some small but decent tamales, menudo, fajita fixings, taco fixings and the salsa bar.  Most of it tasted blah!  Went to the American, wow, they had my least favorite fish again, tilapia!  Carving station had beef and turkey.  The Italian had some dried up baked pasta dish, pizza with lousy crust, spaghetti + meatballs, sausage and peppers and marinara sauce that was so watery it wouldn't stay on the meatballs.

The Chinese section had a variety of foods that my diet couldn't handle so I stayed away.  At the BBQ section they had pulled pork, kielbasa, hot dogs and hamburgers that were not cooked to order but tasty and they had a decent no-bean chili that tasted ok and French fries and corn bread.  There was a decent selection of deserts but no vanilla sauce for the bread pudding.  The NSA deserts had very little variety, but sometimes they put out the cookies which taste ok.  The coffee is pretty decent.

All in all you get what you pay for I guess.  Would not have a problem paying a little extra for better quality food and presentation.

Value. It sucked. 6 bucks for a basket of mixed fries; it had better come with a blow-job. The bread on the burger was a little firm. Not saying stale, but a little firm. The burger was cooked right, but it just missed something. The salads were good, but not great. Just a ho-hum meal. 

Great selection of beers on tap, and a great bar. Great service, too, but the food left too much on the plate to be taken seriously as a $100 burger joint.

The full dinner price is around $50 +tax and I think it's cheap for the unlimited meat you get!! The service is great except for the hostess... she couldn't smile not once. I asked her a simple question and she was a little rude. And I guess she tried to ""make up"" for it when she told me one dish had lobster (which is the soup). Also, she briefly explained the cocktail menu and asked if we have been here before. We said yes. Then she asked my boyfriend if he needed an explanation of the menu. He said no because we know how it works and she goes, ""Well Im going to explain it anyway."" Excuse you??? And I thought maybe she wasn't having it at the time she sat us, but she sat a party behind us and even gave them attitude. Hostess is an important job. You are the first face of the restaurant and that means first impression. I would seriously give this place 3 stars because of her!! I am BIG on customer service. If the service is trash, I wouldn't come back no matter how great the food is. BUT! Our server Jay (his name was more difficult and he told us to call him Jay) was SOOOO nice and kind. He was attentive and I liked that. He smiled the whole time he was explaining things to us. He was just amazing really. He will make this experience great!

The salad bar has variety of different veggies and side dishes to choose from. There's even rice and soup off to the side of the bar. I haven't tried the soup but their salami and grape salad is great! The cheese is rich in flavor and overall a good taste. But save room for the meat that goes around! It's kind of entertaining to watch these people walk around with the huge stick with meat on it! They offer meats such as: lamb, different steaks, & chicken. And the size portions aren't too large so you can try different things! Pretty decent place & i would definitely come back!!",1,0,0

Can't say anything for the food, the initial disappointment with the atmosphere and service was enough for us to decide not to waste our money on a subpar experience (which it would have been regardless of how good the food was).

We arrived here after having had a negative drinks and appetizer experience at Sol Mexican Concina (which was recommended to us by Allan, a Westin concierge when we said we were looking for a place with local flare and high-end service like The Mission in Old Town - oh goodness could they not have been further from the mark). This was also recommended, so we tried it next. The menu looked okay so we decided to give it a try, the hostess tried to insist on having us sit in the small lounge area, but we wanted a more elegant dining experience since it was my birthday, so we asked to be seated in the main dining area. She just looked at us confused, literally twirling a strand of her hair with both hands (i wish I had gotten a photo of this - it would have been down right comical how ditzy she was acting if I weren't hungry and frustrated with the Westin's poor track record with recommendations so far). Ultimately she did seat us in the main dining area, but along a back wall away from everything and everyone EXCEPT* another couple whose booth was situated so that they were staring right at us (so awkward). There was plenty of other seating in the restaurant but we already felt like we were being difficult so we didn't want to bother them by asking to be seated anywhere else. Our waiter came over and told us about the specials that evening, and we had to laugh because their special was the exact same as the special at Sol Mexican Cocina (skirt steak), which both servers pushed pretty hard. I'm guessing it must have been on sale in the area or something? This was when we decided we'd be happier with a movie, a bottle of wine and tapas in our villa - it was sad because we really wanted to have a nice dinner out, but the remorse would have been much greater had we settled for either of the two sad recommendations we received from Allan, the Westin concierge.",1,0,1

The restaurant was pretty busy but it seemed like everyone was working at full speed ahead and were quite efficient!

We decided to get 1 family size pizza to share, Olivio, which is tomato sauce, olives, fresh tomatoes and basil and mozzarella. The pizza came to the table pretty quickly and looked delicious.

Looks were not deceiving! The crust was thin with the right amount of chew and had a lovely rim of char (not burnt) around the outer edge. Moments after it was placed on our table, we were offered fresh parmesan, chili flakes, fresh ground pepper and spicy oil. We chose to add some parmesan and the chili oil. If the pizza was great before, those extras took it over the top.

It was difficult to finish between the two of us. You could easily feed 3 people, even 4 if you got an appetizer to share.

We had the food in a big tupperware, bigger than our dog, and for some reason Karen put down the whole thing, and she said she was sorry. We provided 2 bowls for food and water that weren't used. Always Unleashed charges more for small dogs even though the small dogs don't use the facility like the big dogs. We won't go back because it's expensive for a little guy who sits in a small room on a couch. I will say that the place looks cool for larger dogs, and the larger dogs that are there for daycare were very well-behaved. There weren't any mean or growling animals. If I had a big dog, this is where I would take it.

Re: The negative review about a monsoon, it sounds crazy. There are several covered areas for the dogs, including one that I will describe as a little barn where the dogs congregate when newcomers come. Please delete that negative post. It sounds like a rant over a coupon dispute. Karen very much cares for the dogs, even though I won't go back because it's cost prohibitive. She and her family were going ga-ga over our dog., and shared many cute stories about the week.  In this day and age, these types of reviews are detrimental to a small business' livelihood.

While the wait was short and service was prompt, the experience was truly, truly awful. I was with my husband and his parents for a dinner while they were in town and we were seated fairly quickly in the hibachi section.

During dinner the experience was a constant pounding on the table, yelling,  and consuming of sake bombs. Literally, it was constant. I stopped counting at SEVEN. They were still going at it when we left. Who knows how many they had before that. Not only that, but the management and waiters were taking shots with them. If I wanted to go to a rowdy college bar, I would have done so. Our food was quite delayed because the waitstaff was more focused on their drunk crew at our table. There are private rooms to either side of the main area where we were sitting and it would have been much more appropriate to seat this group in another room. There were children and families on either side of us. One young man next to me almost passed out in his chair as he was so drunk. All we wanted was a nice family meal and I could not run out of there fast enough. The setting was not even suitable for conversation. The language was vulgar, the drinking was excessive, and it was not stopped. While my husband paid the bill I had to excuse myself from the restuarant as the bachelor party was about to take another round of sake bombs and I could not bring myself to watch them take a tenth or eleventh drink in a family setting.

Being the maid of honor (or first female in line in a co-ed wedding) in my best friends wedding comes with certain perks, like I get to meet her in Vegas to look at ceremony options. Walking into the Mandalay Bay I was blown away, I love how it smells like sunscreen, I love the classy floors, I love how they have a shark tank, I love the pool, and I can not wait to stay here for the bachlorette party... 

However, for such a classy hotel their wedding coordination services are sorely lacking. It started out okay, we showed up 30 minutes early and just stopped by to see if the coordinator was available and she was (I now see why!), we waited about 10 minutes and in that 10 minutes I personally saw 2 separate people come in upset with different issues. There was a new girl at the front desk who had no idea where to direct these grandparents where they should go for pictures, nor where she could find someone to help them. The man was upset that no one was answering the phone and they were running behind on some sort of paid for event. 

When the coordinator came out to meet with my blushing bride best friend, she took us back to the ""chapel"" which is a beige room, pretty, but bland, not something my best friend was looking for. She didn't really say anything which was really uncomfortable - she gave us a booklet with information and basically left the bride and I staring at her waiting for her to tell us ANYTHING about the facility. No luck. Instead we grasped around for random questions we didn't really care about while standing in the middle of this medium size room.

This is why I had to give it one star - my friend (the bride) **specifically** asked the coordinator if they had any other options for ceremonies since she is interested in an out door ceremony and she said ""no, this is all we offer"", so we shrugged our shoulders, thanked her and left for lunch - When we sat down to lunch and looked through the packet she gave us there is a WHOLE SECTION on the other options for ceremonies they offer - you can get married in the shark tank!! A cabana!!? Hello!? Are those not ""any other options!?"" 

Maybe the coordinator was pissed we showed up 20 - 30 minutes early, maybe she didn't want to show us a cabana and the shark tank, but hello!? At least tell us about the options! Come to a meeting with information, talk about the services you provide! To convince a bride to drop 5000.00 you better be prepared! Completely disappointed. I have NO clue how they got the ""best of 2008"" on TheKnot.com - yuck! 

Luckily, we came up with an amazing different option and her wedding will kick ass! Sans Mandalay Bay!",4,3,2

As you walk in the door, past the shelves of Aveeda products, you are faced with two desks on either side of the aisle and several receptionists.  I was asked if I had been there before and when I said no, the young lady said she'd escort me downstairs where I was instructed to put on a coverall and leave my jacket if I so wished.  Then was told to go back upstairs and was seated by another receptionist and asked if I wished anything to drink.  Waited with several other customers until Michael, the colorist came to get me (10 minutes past my appointment).  We went upstairs and he asked me if I liked the color I had; I said yes so he went to mix up the color..not having done my hair before,  I was surprised that he got the color just right.  I was watching other customers who were having their hair colored and at the end of the coloring, they were given a shoulder massage by their colorist so I knew what to expect...but this aspect was odd for me; I would have expected to be asked if I wished for a massage, not automatically given one. I don't like being touched by people I don't know but I didn't want to be rude to Michael.

We started off with the dumplings. They were good but their sauce needed more soy sauce added. Then we got the sizzling rice soup w extra $2 sizzling rice. Pretty good. The soup base tasted like chicken noodle soup but the sizzling rice came out perfect! Loved all the extra veggies and shrimp in the soup.

For our main entrees, I got the Kung pao shrimp and my husband got beef n broccoli. Kung pao shrimp was good but a little disappointed it wasn't spicy at all.

Presentation - 5.0 stars.  It measured 8-9 inches.  Uncut, and beautiful.

Pick-up Ability - 1.0 stars.  It was mush in my hands.  Too much sauce.  This doesn't happen at Capriotti's!

Meatballs (3.0 stars) - Heavy, not bready enough to be light.

Sauce (2.0 stars) - a sharp taste, like vinegar.

Cheese (5.0 stars) - wonderful quality of both parm and mozzarella. 

Bread (5.0 stars) - amazing.  Toasty and fresh.

In questioning this, the sales person simply said, ""well she signed for it.""

Our dinner experience started out with us waiting a while for the waitress to come by. Long story short: good (albeit pricey) food, neat ambiance, AWFUL customer service. The latter is enough to make us never come back.

We ordered several entrees and one of almost every taco to share. Really good chips, salsa and guacamole. My favorite tacos were the nopales and rajas tacos - great for vegetarians and for gluten free people like myself. Their horchata was also really good - although $5 per glass is REALLY steep, even for Scottsdale standards.

After slow service but an otherwise pleasant meal, we gave our waitress our credit card to pay our check and that's when the %&*# hit the fan. We waited for over 20 minutes for them to come back with our credit card to no avail. It wasn't until we looked over and saw about 5 people with flash lights and knives in a commotion, including our waitress. When she saw us looking over, she finally came over and told us she lost our credit card since it had fallen and got knocked under a large generator behind a wall. Accidents happen, sure, and we would have been TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING  had she apologized and said they were trying to get it out, however the first thing that came out of her mouth was, ""so I'm sorry, I'm going to need another form of payment"" to which my husband responded he would like to pay with the credit card he gave her. She then became upset and said it was an accident, and got even more mad when we asked to speak with a manager. At this point we have been sitting there for over 30 minutes.

We were heading back home the next day and having to potentially cancel the credit card on which our rental car was on and flight would be a great inconvenience, and could not wrap our heads around how neither the manager nor the waitress thought this was a big deal or how they could not conceive why we were upset. They asked us to ""come back later"" as they continued to look for the card but asked that we put down another card for them to charge in case they did not get it out. In hindsight, we shouldnt have done this. After going down the street for some dessert they finally called us to come pick up our card. No apology again, no nothing.

The management of this store is extremely rude and condescending. 

I stopped in to have my leaf blower repaired. After being told that it would be 4-6 weeks or maybe longer to complete the repair, I asked why it would take so long. The manager actually told me, ""You didn't buy this here so we're going to fix the equipment that was purchased here first.  If we run out of work with that equipment, then we will work on your blower.  We'll use your repair as filler.""  In an effort to possibly help speed up the repair, I attempted to communicate the troubleshooting steps that I had already taken. When I began to speak, the manager rolled his eyes, interrupted me and said, ""Ya, we'll look at it when we get time."" and he continued to convey to me how fortunate I was that they were going to look at it at all. 

When I inquired how much a new Toro blower would be, he told me that they only sell the best equipment so they won't sell me a Toro. I wondered how Toro would feel about one of their certified repair shops telling customers that their products are not high quality!

My recommendation is that you stay away from these arrogant and rude people.",0,0,0

It's a bit off the strip so definitely quieter and less hustle and bustle. Luckily, I went with a party of 4 as soon as they opened. We still had to wait about 30 minutes, but considering how small the place was, the line moved pretty fast. They had 5 main desserts on the menu, of which we ordered 4. 

Ringo (5\/5): Originally we weren't planning on getting this one cuz it sounded just like an apple pie, but I'm so so so glad we did. It was one of my favorites of the day. Everything about this dessert just worked. There was a small apple pie with tart apples and a crispy, flakey, buttery crust. It was paired with a honey ice cream that was so delicate, but so fragrant. Together, the 2 were a match made in heaven. And as if that wasn't enough, there was a small candy apple on the side that was filled with the lightest whipped cream and a caramel sauce. It was a fun play on apple pie and salted caramel apple pie. This was definitely a crowd favorite because seconds after it hit the table, we were all essentially fighting to lick the plate clean. 

Mars (4\/5): This dessert was both fun to watch and fun to eat. The server used a blowtorch to eat up some alcohol, which she then poured on top of the little red dome of white chocolate on our plate. Inside was yuzu mousse that paired perfectly with the white chocolate, brandy, and fruits inside. It wasn't too sweet due to the alcohol and the yuzu which added a hint of tang, bitterness, and freshness.
 
Primavera (5\/5): My other favorite of the day. This didn't look as beautiful as the other desserts since it was assembled in a wine glass, but the flavors made up for it. The coconut panna cotta inside was so good. Not too sweet, but you could definitely taste the coconut. It went so well with the strawberry sauce and the fruits inside. This was super refreshing. I recommend trying to dig your spoon all the way to the bottom and grabbing a little bit of everything in one bite to get the full effect of this one. 

Mt. Charleston (2\/5): Sadly, we did not enjoy this dessert as much as the other ones. I personally wasn't a fan of the lavender. It was a bit too floral for my liking and didn't work well with the sweetness of the meringue. Overall, the dish was a bit too bitter and the components on the plate didn't mesh together. It left a strange aftertaste in our mouthes. 

All in all, I would definitely come back here to try more of their desserts if I'm ever in the Las Vegas area again. 

Cons: 
- Skip the Mt. Charleston
- Gets super crowded if you come late
- Hard to find parking
- Super small interior

Pros: 
- Amazingly well thought out desserts 
- Cute interior (love the tea tins on the wall and the giant wine cooler)
- Great service and friendly staff",1,0,0

The meats are huge, the Salad's are huge, the potato was the size of my two fists side by side! and the dessert was very sharable.  Your bill will be more reasonable if you split the entree.  :)

The bonus on our visit was that waitress was the sweetest, most helpful, kind, and patient wait staff I've EVER dealt with.

The wife and I went for our wedding anniversary off of a special that MGM was running on many of the cirque shows. 

What I liked:
- The interactive nature of the pre-show. There was lots of comedy, some peeping and lots of talking with some of the characters.
- The comedy was crass and very funny. The performers were great in character, and really knew how to play off the crowd.
- The acrobatic performers were great.
- The live band was great, something different from some other shows. 
- The MC was very fun and enjoyable. 

What was mediocre: 
- It wasn't as ""sexy"" as I expected. There was definitely some sexy scenes, but some of the ones that should have been sexy just weren't.
- There was more comedy than there should have been. More acrobatics would have been nice. 

There wasn't anything I strongly disliked. I do appreciate that Zumanity attempts to appeal to a wide adult audience. I wouldn't say there is anything really risqué, but it wasn't straight laced (pun intended).

But in the 6 times I've visited this and the other nearby location I've left without my food twice. I like to call ahead and grab and go. On multiple occasions I have called and no one would answer. Recently I called, a woman took my order, but when I arrived there was no record of it until they played detective and found the worker did not ""send the order back"" to the kitchen.  Then the woman came up to me and said yes she took my order but since she did not see my phone number on her caller ID she didn't bother to send it back to the kitchen staff. She did not apologize.  Her attitude was as if it was my fault. I asked her if she asked me for my phone number and she acknowledged that she had not. I don't think she got my point. 

On this same visit while I was waiting in line to ""pick up my food"" (ha ha) saw the shift manager wrestle huge bags of garbage out through the side door. I then watched him go back directly to the kitchen and then ask if he could help me figure out where my food was.  He wanted to make my food while I waited. He was very nice but seemed surprised or a little put off when I suggested he wash his hands first (after handling the garbage). He gave me a look like how dare I be such a pain in his a66.  He then left and quickly came back putting on latex gloves. I decided to just leave. I called back to speak to the owner and 'resentful glove man' decided to lecture me on the difference between owners and managers in a franchise situation. After much convincing he finally agreed to pass my phone number on to a manager. WHEW!!! 

I'm SO GLAD I didn't let this guy fix my food and just left.  I have a rule: I never eat food prepared by someone with any amount of resentment for me. Even if it is undeserved. I have seen the You Tube videos of what kitchen staff do to your food when they play God with your health.

Their drinks are made with real fruit, hence the name, instead of powders that most other places use. The mango diamond drink is made with blended mango with ice and a few pieces of cubed mangoes. I wish that there were more pieces of mangoes.",2,1,2

I ordered orange and lemon chicken, fried rice, white rice, lo mein, fried wontons, and crab puffs. With each thing I tried it all just got worse and worse. Everything was incredibly bland. The breading on the chicken was soggy. The fried rice was literally rice and soy sauce (I was expecting things like egg, peas, carrots, etc. to be in it). The noodles were cooked fine, just boring. The fried wontons   unexpectedly had no filling. Eating the crab puffs was like opening a Lay's potato chip bag: more air inside than filling.

To find Le Cirque, first, go towards the back of Bellagio when entering from the main entrance past many of the restaurants.  Signs will start appearing about halfway in.  

The decor of Le Cirque is intimate and cozy.  Not a big fan of the old circus paintings and the colors personally but you do get a nice view of the Bellagio fountains from here.  

Service here is outstanding all-around.  Great stories from the waiters; explanations of all the dishes; constant checks of water to supplies.  No problems.  

The menu is a prix-fixe menu of different sorts (most of them are +$100).  A few of the options also have extra costs affixed.  The one I chose was with an appetizer\/entree\/dessert.  They also have a cocktail menu (and wine\/beer) ranging from $16+.  For the cocktail, I received the deja vu which is gin with cucumber flavors - pretty good and love the presentation\/cocktail shaker. You also get bread (lots of flavors) and salted\/unsalted butter.  We also got a seafood amuse-bouche which was pretty interesting and even had some gold on it.  

For the appetizer, I got the risotto which came with lobster.  It was pretty good although the texture was a little strange with the nuts and fruit-like food involved.  I then got the sea bass which came in an egg roll shape.  I thought the presentation was interesting but the taste was fairly not that special here with the salty\/vinegar-y sauce and the egg roll style dominating the flavors too much.  Finally, I got the pistachio dessert - the bar which wasn't too shabby with good flavor profiles.  The included buttermilk ice cream though was tasteless in my experience.  We also got some small desserts for free but I was told the flavors weren't that special here.  Most of these dishes had that similar deconstructed feel as well which all looked interesting\/cool but the flavors always were a bit all over the [lace.  

Le Cirque isn't bad by any means in terms of the quality of service or experience.  Just the food I felt wasn't completely connecting taste-wise with the creativity behind the dishes.",3,2,3

A friend of mine has a bit too much cheap, watered-down vodka and gets escorted through some nondescript door accompanied by another friend of questionable sobriety. The guard posted at the door isn't going to let me follow, so I grill him as to where I'm going to meet them. He doesn't know. Wait, what? You're telling me your job description as a security guard is so ****ing dynamic that you cannot possibly predict where a drunk patron of your club is going to be escorted? You gotta be shitting me. Sorry, but I'm not circling the Venetian to check all the exits that my friends may or may not come out of.  If I'm asking you a question and you're on the job, you FIND OUT. ""I don't know"" doesn't cut it. Telling me a story about how I would understand if I were at K-Mart doesn't cut it. ""I don't know"" ends with a story on Yelp about how stupid you are. 

Almost everyone working for that club is useless. How they remember to breathe is one of life's great mysteries. The Venetian should be embarrassed by the coordination of their security personnel. Absolutely inept. All of them were clueless. One of the security guards actually tried to help and I give him all the credit in the world. His earpiece didn't give him access to the proper channels to find out what was going on, but he went in person to find out and came back to follow up with me.

We both had the Grilled Salmon. I like mine cooked well and often that means dry and overcooked. It's tough not to over do. But Paul Martin got it just right. It was cooked all the way through and still moist. I thought the portion was large - especially for lunch. The bread didn't win any points. It was kind of a slab of bread and easily skipped (helps the diet plan!).
We ended with their Banana Cream PIe and coffee. The Banana Cream pie had a thin layer of chocolate. It didn't overwhelm the bananas. Banana Cream pie can be a heavy dessert. This was light and didn't overwhelm the senses. The coffee was great.
Everyone who worked there, were pleasant, polite and had great smiles. They certainly gave the feeling that we were welcomed. 

The only things that slightly f took away from the experience. We were at a booth right next to the kitchen. There's a whole row of booths that are parallel to the kitchen. There was a lot of noise before the restaurant was half full. We sat at the outside edge of the booth to hear over the noise. Odd for a place like this. 
And the service was great once they discovered us. I sat for over 10 minutes without being acknowledged by a waiter or asking if I wanted a drink while I waited for my friend. My friend arrived and it was almost another 10 minutes before we were noticed. The waiter made up for it - service was amazing after that. Just odd because the restaurant wasn't that busy and many waiters went by but no one seemed to take notice. Very minor point and certainly the waiter gave fantastic service after that.",1,0,0

Check-in\/Check out was quick, organized and easy. Stayed in a deluxe suite, which was large enough for 2 people. There is a small kitchenette that includes a fridge and a stovetop.

Pool area is fairly small, but still nice. The bar\/cabanas were closed for winter. Not a lot in terms of dining at the Vdara. You can get food at the lobby bar. There's also a small market and a Starbucks in the hotel. But for any real dining, you are better off going to the Aria next door.

Vdara is part of the MGM conglomerate, which includes Aria, Bellagio, MGM Grand, etc. So, entertainment and dining across those properties is easily put on the room bill. We had a $50 food and drink credit-- and they wound up comping our food at Julian Serrano next door in the Aria--which came to about $65.

Parking is really easy, should you have a car. Valet is free and quick.

Upon intake, the nurse who came did not bring her stethoscope, was not going to assess my grandmother and she did not know answers to certain questions.  After asking for her to come in to assess my grandmother, she explains to us that she doesn't think she will pass this week. She indicated people are close to passing when they are confused and when they have a fever. My grandmother never got confused and she never had a fever. She also passed 11 hours later. 

Hospice is supposed to provide comfort; we were promised liquid morphine-fast forward a few hours when my grandmother was severely uncomfortable with her pain and the pill morphine we had was not working and just causing more nausea, a call was placed to hospice. We were promised a call back in 5 minutes; 45 minutes later and another call on our end was placed. An hour and a half after the initial call, the same intake nurse shows up-empty handed. She then explains how she placed an order for the liquid morphine and it would be delivered later that night. Well what happens now?  The answer we were provided: You can administer the morphine pills through her rectum, without any instruction\/demonstration, just a ""go for it"" attitude. Disappointing.  Also disappointing, there was almost like a push for us to transport her to their inpatient unit. That seemed to be the only sure answer she had for any of our questions and\/or concerns. 

The liquid morphine was finally delivered a few hours later-her final hours. The only positive thing I can say about Solari Hospice is the chaplain services; Chuck was great. He will be speaking at my grandmothers memorial service. 

After her passing at 12:20am and a call was made immediately to hospice, a nurse came around 1:40am and she was officially pronounced at 1:44am. She brought a printer, which didn't work. It just didn't seem professional. All she had to do was the officially time of death, fill out a piece of paper and call the funeral home we chose. Which, thankfully, we had other family members to recommend a funeral home because we had no clue where to start. Apparently a social worker was supposed to make contact with us ""at the end of the week"" but you'd think there would not be such a lag for such services, especially if the social workers are supposed to assist with information on funeral homes. 

After calling the funeral home, the nurse was hurrying to clean up and dress my grandmother because the funeral home was on their way. She was rough with my grandmother's body-there was no dignity, no respect. To make things worse, she asked for us to help dress her; How traumatizing!!!  The whole thing wasn't even done until 3:45am. My family and I have felt completely unsupported during this difficult time. 

My family and I will definitely have a sour taste about hospice services in the future if they are ever recommended again because of this experience, which is sad because this service, with a different agency, can definitely be helpful.",1,0,0

This didn't happen when I went to a wax specialist that used higher quality wax and who didn't rush through the whole thing by using larger wax areas.

The young lady that took the call was very nice and helpful. I wanted to have the vehicle picked up at 7am, however she advised that if I waited until 8am the charges were less. She gets kudos for her good customer service. It stops there.

I planned the rest of my work appointments based on their arrival at 8, one of which was to get my mom to a Dr. Appt at 8:30, which was by the dealership. But at 8:05, no tow truck, no call to say they were running late. I send my mom on her way and will have to ride to the dealership in the tow truck; and get to my mom's vehicle from there -hoping the dealership will take me (yes, they did. They rock!! That would be Desert Audi). 

At 8:10 I call and before I can say why I am calling I am put on hold for 8 minutes. I hung up and called back. I was not put on hold this time, provided my information to be told ""oh yea, he's 15 minutes out."" Like it was no big deal. 

I then asked why I wasn't informed that they were running behind? That I had called ahead to make an appointment so that is very thing would not happen. She transfered me to Dispatch.

Dispatch, after going over the details again, advised they were having driver problems. I asked why they didn't call to say they would be running behind...crickets! He apologized, unsympathetically. I asked for an answer - not an apology...crickets. 

The Driver shows up 10 minutes later, he professional and nice, but I don't want to 'chit chat' I am running behind. When I asked why he was late, he said, ""you're faraway from our base (maybe 10 miles) and traffic was heavy. In my head I  thinking ""Of course traffic was heavy, dumba**, it's rush hour on a Wednesday."" I, of course clean it up, as it leaves my lips. They knew when they dispatched him at 8, yes the time of my appointment, he would not be there on time. But no call. Lazy, bad customer service.

So, no good deed goes unpunished, yet again. The paperwork wasn't even completed with the details provided on the phone, this was another 15 minutes once the car was unloaded. 

My hope is to never need a tow again, but one should never say never.  My advice is to call someone else.",2,0,0

Our place was trashed.  Interesting how they got in since we had our alarm system on.  Turns out that anyone at all can access the electrical box since it isn't locked and can turn off the electricity to a specific apartment.  Then they can break in and no alarms go off.  There is no backup battery for the alarm system.  There is absolutely NO security here.  For the last 3 months the security gates were open 24\/7 the whole time.  Their excuse was they were working on them.  I never saw anyone working.  No one really works here.  The maintenance staff is inept and management spends all their time trying to recruit new tenants.  I have a disability and they have refused to give me a handicap parking space even though I have presented all my Nevada disability and Medical paperwork.  Instead, I was given a small sign in front of a space that says ""Reserved Parking"".  What a joke!  I have never been able to use the space except for a few times because everyone else just parks there because the management lets them do it  They just put notes on their cars telling them they can't park there.  I'm supposed to call the office whenever some one else takes the space and report their license plate numbers.  I am supposed to be the parking police.  There is no penalty for those parking there illegally.  So everyday I have to find myself another space when I can only walk a very limited number of feet.  And guess what NO ONE at CONAM cares.

Iggs is the restaurant, serving starters and main meals. Barioja is the tapas bar. The contrast between the two in terms of ambience was quite clear the night I went. Iggs was full of fine diners, quiet and subdued. Barioja was spilling over with Festival go'ers and had that real Spanish-street tapas feel about it.

We had a voucher for Iggs, although in honesty I probably would have preferred to try Barioja. The boy, who is a born and bred Spaniard, tells me the tapas at Barioja is really good. But we both agreed that the meals at Iggs were ok, but just that. 

My quail starter was quite nice, with lentils and red peppers. But my rabbit main was quite dry. I know rabbit is a hard meat to cook, but it really was a little too dry to enjoy. The steak the boy had looked a-ok, but just that.

The service was friendly. The ambience a little stuffy. I don't know, there's something about it here that felt fine but didn't seem to shine in any particular way. The menu was a little by-the-book.

I think where this restaurant DOES shine is the tapas bar next door. It was bustling, lively, lots of different interesting things on the menu. Cooking tapas is different to cooking main meals. The meals were a little uninspired and I felt lacking the love and enthusiasm of the little plate offerings next door.

A little disappointed to be honest, but it certainly wasn't a bad experience. Just underwhelming. Next time I'll try the tapas for sure.",4,0,5

I've visited many of them and love them just as much as the next desert dweller.  But every now and then I have pangs of guilt and inadequacy over having never been to a place that everybody else identifies as a Phoenix institution.  Like I'm an impostor and haven't really earned my Phoenix stripes yet because I haven't visited Carolina's or Ranch Market or Pete's Fish and Chips. 

Well, my Phoenix cred just ratcheted up a notch or so with my visit to Pete's Fish and Chips on Indian School and 44th Street.  This place has been here forever.  I've seen the bumper stickers (I'm addicted to Pete's Fish and Chips!) on the back of cars since, oh I don't know, birth??  It is a family owned business with a friendly, but no frills attitude.  There are all kinds of rules and restrictions, but that keeps the prices at amazingly low levels.  If you go to Pete's, keep the following in mind....Bring cash, its all they take.  Also, know that the sauce they serve is a spicy red sauce similar to cocktail sauce.  They have tartar sauce on hand but you have to request it.  

We ordered a 4 piece fish and chips and a 10 piece shrimp and chips.  I picked it up at the drive thru and brought it home.  Honestly, I was a bit worried about this scenario because I thought I might run the risk of having the food be cold and soggy by the time I got home.  And really, what's worse than cold fish and chips??  Luckily, I don't live too far away and the food was still piping hot 10 minutes after we unwrapped and started eating.  

The fish was crisp, flaky and delicious.  Very good with the red sauce.  I wouldn't say that this type of fish and chips is representative of the British pub style meal.  It is more in the style of beach shack dining on the East Coast.  The shrimp were less than impressive, 90% breading, 10% shrimp.  Don't think we'll order that again.  Chips were standard fare.  Nothing impressive, but they did the job.  The total for the two meals was $14.02.  Just the right price in this economy.  And even better?  Pete's is the kind of place where if you pay that bill with a $20, they just go ahead and give you $6 back in change.  No messing with a handful of coins.  We'll be back to Pete's when the f'n'c craving hits us.  Glad to have it in the neighborhood.",4,2,5

Four dishes fed 7 girls, and we probably would have been just fine with 3 entrees instead of being greedy and adding the fourth.

The star of the show was the Chicken Benedict. Delish! The sauce and melted cheese... Mmm.. The flavor is different from your traditional Benedict with hollandaise sauce, and well worth your time. 

Everything else we ordered though kind of fell flat for me. Bland... Boring... A waste of my stomach space. I was looking forward to the chicken and waffles most but I had a few bites and abandoned it.

The guy who prepared my food was so kind; he asked politely if I would like to hear of all the foods they were serving! I couldn't decide and ended up getting A Little Bit of Everything ($20) and a water ($1). The food was delicious and had so much variety.

The place is small and by no means ""modern"" or ""upscale"" looking. But, that's what I liked. They were very clearly promoting veganism, health, and peace as evident in their many posters, signs, and paintings. In this technology world that's consumed by superficiality, it's nice to see a small business not concerned with appearance and more concerned with the message they are putting out there.

Outstanding beer selection, as always. Expedition Stout on tap is something you won't see very often. Wish it was on cask, but they had a great brown ale in that department. My excitement, though? An awesome Destihl Altbier and, more importantly, Duchesse de Bourgnogne on tap! It's one of those nice sours that's not too sweet, which is a problem mainly.

So, why 4 stars? Well, Malthouse got Jacobins on tap this week, and if I'm giving them 5 stars for having one of the best sours, then Maduro gets 4 for one that's ""only"" very good.

I was greeted as soon as I walked in, and was told to take a seat, as I was early for my appointment. So far everything was great, and the salon looked really clean.

When it was my time to get my nails done, the girl who took care of me was really nice! So the service was great. However, when the nail tech girl started to push back my cuticles, she pressed really hard and was quite rough with my nails. She also cut one side of the skin around my nails, and it hurt as I put my hands under the UV ray lantern (My finger hurt for 2 days). I didn't say anything, because I'm a little too nice sometimes. I was also anticipating that my nails were going to look great after I was done, so that's another reason I didn't say anything.

While the shellac nail polish was applied on to my nails, I noticed it didn't look like the colour that I initially picked. I wanted a white colour and I got a light pink instead. I politely said that the colour is different than what I picked initially, and the nail tech girl advised it would get whiter after the second application of polish was applied. It never got whiter lol.

So again I didn't complain, and I thought after everything was done, that my nails would look great anyway, and that it would compensate for all the negative stuff. 

Well, when everything was finished, I looked at my nails and noticed that there was a really thick application of polish applied to my nails and it ended up making my nails look stubby. I've been to other nail salons, and the good ones all applied thin layers of nail shellac on to my nails. My nails at Kim's salon did not look very good. It looked unprofessional, and was a bit upset. But again, I didn't say anything because I only paid 35 dollars for the service. 

I do want to say that my nail tech girl was really nice, and she still applied the Polish quickly and somewhat evenly, just wayyy too thick of an application. 

I would have almost preferred that the nails be done really well, and have the girls not that friendly, but hey what can you do. I may go once more and perhaps advise them next time not to lay on the polish so thick, and see how my nails turn out. But I guess you get what you pay for, right?

Update:

I went back to this salon once again, to get another shellac manicure, in hopes that I could give this salon one more try.

Once again I was greeted with a friendly face, and I was told to have a seat while I waited for my appointment to start (I arrived a bit early). Once it was time for my nails to be done, I was seated, and the girl who was doing my nails proceeded to wrap my nails in foil wrapping to take off the old shellac that I had on my nails from my prior appointment at this salon. Once again the girl that worked on my nails was really friendly! 

Once the foil wraps were taken off my fingers of my right hand, she proceeded to scrape off the shellac very  roughly with her utensil (it actually hurt a bit). I spoke up this time, and politely said that she should perhaps leave on the foil wrapping with the acetone on my nails for a little longer, so that she could have an easier time to scrape it off. (Also, I didn't want my nails to be ruined by overly scraping them, and didn't want to have any pain lol). She advised me that leaving the acetone on my nails longer would not help take the shellac off easier?? She advised me that the colour I was wearing was somehow different and more difficult to take off my nails, then the other colours they had?? This did not make sense to me, because when she took off the foil wrapping from my left hand (which had soaked in the acetone for longer), the shellac came off quite easily). And the shellac that I had on prior to this appointment, came from this very salon. Once again, a disappointing experience at this salon. 

The colour that was applied also initially looked really streaky, and the girl had to apply 4 coats of the shellac to make it look more opaque and not as streaky lol. It ended up looking good at the end though. (Not sure why I needed 4 coats of the colour for my nails to look good). And I'm not including the clear base and top coat. The nail polish must have been newer, because even with the 4 coats, the application didn't end up looking as thick as the last time that my nails were done here. Once again, I didn't get the colour I wanted, which was a more translucent white colour, as oppose to the opaque white colour I got, but my nails ended up looking decent in the end.  

Unfortunately, I left the two star rating because of the fact that 3 of my nails are a little sore from the scraping of the shellac (I've never had that happen). But I didn't take away any stars, because my nails looked a bit better this time. They still did not look completely professional, but looked decent (better than last time). I wish I could have had a better experience, I really wanted to love this salon.",1,5,0

The arrangement delivered didn't have the cedar, fir, red berries, or holly. 

I called and the person I spoke with told me the arrangement wouldn't look like the photo online, because they use all kinds of tricks to make the arrangements look more full in the photos, like putting the greenery in the back and the flowers in the front. I told her I understood that, but what they delivered didn't even have the elements described in the description. She sounded exasperated and said she would send out another arrangement, but said they don't have any holly. I said they shouldn't accept the order if they can't deliver described arrangement. She repeated that they would send another arrangement. I asked if it was going to be close to the photo and she said it would have greenery and berries, but wouldn't have holly. They did send another that was very similar to the first, but with some greenery and berries.

After trekking it on the 501 Streetcar\/Bus combo, I got off at...Ontario Street? Thank gosh it was daytime is al I gotta say. 

Anyways, I walked a block south to Richmond and there it was, Mengrai.

Inside it was awesome. There was a huge budda display that has some neat religious aspects to it. There also was like a elephant head-bust on the wall, which my niece was IN LOVE WITH. I'm pretty sure we convinced her tthat we were at the rainforest cafe. 

We had:

Apps 

Thai Mango Salad - I'm not actually a fan of mango in my food, but this was good. I'm sure mango afficianado's would say its amazing, but to me it was just okay. 

Thai Spring Rolls - They were tiny, but good. Basic spring roll fare. Though, the sweet chili sauce that were served with it was PHENOMENAL. I'm not usually a fan of sweet chili, but it was SO GOOD.

Mains

Green Curry - Really good, but not spicy enough for me. Other people seemed to enjoy it too. It was gone first lol.

The Tenderloin with a pomegranate and balsamic reduction - So um, here's the thing. I really was looking forward to this, but we had to desecrate it and orrder it well done. Our fault. So when it arrived, the meat looked well done, but as we dug deeper in to the meat, the middle part of it was rare? Weird, but I like rare so I was happy to eat that part. Also, the meat had a very distinct burnt taste. My guess is that it was thrown onto the grill when it was waaaaaay too hot and didn't get enough time to cook all the way through. The pomegranate and balsamic reduction was delicious on the veggies underneath, but really really brought out the burnt flavours of the meat.


Bangkok Style Pad Thai - SO GOOD. ALL THAT CHICKEN AND ALL THAT SHRAMPZ. 


Sides: 

Jasmine & Coconut Rice - Good! Not burnt or anything. 


Deserts:

Banana Fritters w Mango Ice Cream - SOOO GOOD. Loved the mango ice cream. I was too full though at this point so I just tasted the ice cream and a bite of the fritter. Still really good though. Mango Ice Cream tasted like it was made rather than bought, which is a huuuuuuuuge bonus.

Desert Trio - It was like 3 squares, one was a brownie, the other looked like a coconut date square and I don't know what the third was. I didn't try them though, but my niece was all about the brownie!


FINAL NOTES:

The service was excellent here. My water glass never reached below half point, seriously. It was constantly being refilled. The servers were super attentive and checked on us an appropriate amount of times. At one point, we had asked for sambal and likee half an hour later they still hadn't given it to us. But when we asked the waiter, he apologized profusely and said that it had slipped his mind. He looked genuine so it was no biggs, He was a nice guy in the end.

The food took a long time to come even though there was no one else there when we sat down. I understand that the ingredients are fresh and from scratch so maybe that's why it took longer.  As other reviews have mentioned, the price was high for the small portions, especially the hefty upcharge for the forbidden rice.

I ordered a chicken sandwich at this restaurant without mayo -- after waiting quite a while (I was one of two people in line), I finally received my sandwich. I checked the sandwich outside, just to be sure it had no mayo...it did. I returned, told the man who took my order (perhaps the owner?) that the sandwich had mayo -- he grabbed it from my hands, and gave it to one of his workers, who then came back with it about two minutes later. I thanked him and left. I again checked the sandwich when I got outside, and saw that the bread had been replaced, but mayo was still all over the chicken. I returned to the restaurant and told the man that it still had mayo, the man yelled at me and slammed the sandwich on the counter, insisting the sandwich did not have mayo. I showed him that mayo was still all over the chicken and asked for my money back -- a nicer man from the back of the restaurant thankfully came out and apologized and returned my money.

However, they do have some unique and interesting food on their menu, which gives them the right to charge more for those; you cannot find it anywhere else, and they should be compensated for their innovative creations.

I did not like the dumplings at all. It is just 8 small deep fried dumplings in a fatty creamy sauce mixed with hot pepper oil for $8. This was a rip-off.

The rest of my food was fine. I would have actually enjoyed it more if they were not so overly sweet.

We came from California to this particular center since they carry a difficult-to-find vaccine that we needed for a trip.  Administering this vaccine is a judgement call because in rare cases it may have severe side effects.  I was concerned that the company, whose business is selling vaccines, may under-estimate the risks.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Upon arrival I was asked to enter all relevant information into a computer terminal (this can be done ahead of time from home).  Then we met with a very attentive, kind and patient Physician Assistant - Ms. Jacqueline House.  Ms. House studied the information very carefully and asked many specific questions about our travel destination.  She consulted detailed maps and guide, pin-pointing our travel to specific cities, in order to properly assess the level of risk - site-specific and cumulative - that we will face.  Ms. House also studied my wife's medical history and allergies - a very large volume of data - to assess her specific risk factors.  Ms. House presented the information clearly and in a language we could understand, and was very supportive and emphatic to specific concerns I presented.  The level of attention and personal care we received far exceeded my expectations.  The conclusion of the entire process was that I received a waiver for the vaccine due to health risks, and my wife received the vaccine.  In addition for the specific vaccine we came for, Ms. House provided extensive guidance on health risks that are particular for our trip route, and made specific recommendations on how to minimize these risks through preparation.  I am over 60 years old and this was one of the best experiences I have ever had in a medical facility.",0,0,0

Stratta seemed like a good option.  The decor is great, with dark woods, deep reds,  and large plum lamps hanging from the ceiling.  

The service was absolutely terrible.  Our waiter not only had zero personality, he truly seemed like he wanted us to leave.  After we ordered one round of martinis and a personal pizza each, he handed us our check.  Um...excuse me...we were planning on drinking some more?  Perhaps having dessert?

Not one to be defeated by a rude waiter, I flagged him back down and asked him in my most venomous but syrupy tone, ""Excuse me, do you mind if we order more?""  He gave us a very insincere apology, took the check back, and took our second round of drink orders.  He never even offered to show us the dessert menu.

Our second round of drinks came--and guess what he plopped down on the table with them: the CHECK.  It was Sunday night and  the place was not anywhere near closing, nor was there a line of people waiting to sit down....WTF??  Didn't we just go over this?

We drank our last round, gave him a crappy tip (which is not my style), and left.  

The food was okay; my tomato\/basil pizza crust was undercooked and I would have liked more basil.  The drinks were seemingly inventive when you read them off the menu, but were not nearly as interesting in real life.  My first drink was a gin\/raspberry juice\/sage martini.  I didn't see or taste any sage, and it basically tasted like a cosmo.  (The raspberry juice was clearly not fresh, as I would expect it to be for $14.)  My second drink was some kind of orange concoction that tasted like an orange Starburst.  It was tastey, but too sweet.

The menu offers weekday and weekend specials including Bún Bò Hue (Spicy Beef noodle soup), Bánh Canh Cua ( Crab meat with Udon noodle soup), Bò Kho ( beef stew noodle soup). Though it's small, the place is clean and the service is fast. 
I always order Pho or Bun Bo Hue (my favourite Vietnamese noodle soup). The broth was clear and okay, not very tasty. So if you want to make it tastier, you know what to do: sriracha and hoisin sauce! The beef was nicely cut, and fresh. They didn't lump together like most Vietnamese restaurants do it. 

I tried their Bánh Canh Cua once. I, personally, didn't like it. It was good, but not like what I expected. Since I was born and raised in Vietnam, I have high expectation for Vietnamese food wherever I go. I understand it's hard to get the ingredients here, but their bánh canh cua is way too different than the right one. The broth was thicker than Pho's, and they use the noodle that is similar to Udon. Oh well, gotta agree that they are very generous. Despite the size of the bowl, their bánh canh cua came with three crab claws. *yummy*

Bún Bò Hue is my favourite noodle soup. Again, their soup and broth was okay but I have no complaints. When the weather gets cold, and I feel like soup when I'm at York, I don't mind at all busing there for some hot, almost-tasty soup. Don't try this soup when you're wearing a white top!!!

I heard that their bánh cun (stuffed pancake) is very good. That's what they're known for. The owner himself told me their bánh cun is homemade. However, I always end up ordering bánh bèo (steamed rice cake). They are topped with mashed green bean, shredded pork and shredded pork skins, and served with fish sauce. (Everything tastes good with fish sauce if you make it right)

Not authentic Vietnamese food I have to say, but overall it's not bad. The food and service was A-OK. But you are at YorkU and want to try something new (especially in the cold weather), come here and check it out! Take my words, it's WAY BETTER than student centre's or Yorklanes' food.",2,1,1

I will admit I was a little nervous but played into it as best I could. They first took me up center isle where my fiancé was identified in the crowd and then took me onto the stage where they began to perform their skit. All the dancers first introduced themselves to me as part of a dating game, then each performed to a short song clip, and then the ""winner"" (whom I did not choose), took me through some doors that les to the backstage. What I was not privy to, was that when the doors closed the projector made the doors appear to be hotel room doors that closed and had a ""do not disturb"" sign on them as the dancers performed... Dance Moves insinuating that I was having sex with the ""winner"" backstage. When the ""winner"" came out he was smoking a cigarette like we had just had sex. This was all unbeknownst to me until after the show when multiple patrons approached me, and I found my fiancé yelling at the Jabbawockeez manager. I had no idea of how I had been portrayed, and felt dirty and humiliated. 

Obviously there are no women performers, or stage characters, and it is problematic that an all male crew takes unsuspecting women onstage to affirm their belief that they can compete and then assume women as trophies for sex. It is #Vegas and I am sure there were women at the show who would have loved to participate even knowing what was going to happen, but I did not sign a waiver or release for this and believe that the most popular Vegas family show needs to change its content or have patrons sign a release acknowledging the sexual and #misogynistic content of their show. 

While my fiancé and I were huge #Jabbawockeez fans in the past we understand that this country has a huge moral gap between what we as citizens know is right, and what we actually do. Therefore we are seeking legal resources to change this production's irresponsible (and honestly mediocre) show, and to help us with their complete unresponsiveness to our grievances that we filed directly following the show.",3,6,1

The french toast was great, and the eggs were cooked to order as specified (basted) and properly seasoned.  Tonight I had the ribeye, one of my favorite cuts, fat and all.  The meat was a good cut, very tender, well seasoned and cooked as ordered (medium rare on the rare side).  The garlic mashed potatoes were flavorful and creamy and chunky at the same time.  The green beans were cooked properly (not too crunchy, not too soft) cooked in butter and server with crumbled bacon).  The service was very good and we chatted with the owner for a few minutes after dinner.  Too full for dessert we had coffee, which was fresh (nothing worse than ""cooked"" coffee).  we don't usually drink alcohol, we had soft drinks.  All in dinner was under $70 for two, which isn't cheap, but a good steak isn't normally cheap.

I was afraid since they are doing so many weddings that we would not get the attention and cooperation we would need, but the staff was very accommodating, helpful, and friendly. We made several changes after the original contact, and they helped us all along the way. They were busy at wedding time,but everything ran smoothly - took time to answer all our questions. I was afraid too that Elvis might be bored or detached, but he was extremely gracious, got to know us, smiled a lot and put on a memorable performance. The Elvis ceremony is just a show, but the real marriage service was performed by a sincere and gracious minister named John.

I really enjoyed the location; not far from the Marriage License Bureau (another helpful resource). The chapel itself is lovely; small but clean and picturesque. Lots of photo opportunities in front, inside, and on the side. 

We are both in our 70s, and have been together many years, so we thought this would be fun way to 'elope' and show that old folks can have fun too. I was not disappointed!  It was lively and audacious, but we also saw a tender and committed side too, befitting the important nature of a loving marriage.  

I liked the Chinese-Menu style of services. We went with a low-cost alternative, but then added a few sentimental extras - like buying a shirt that they sell at the front counter, and we added the DVD too.

All-in-all, we were very pleased and have a lot to tell the grand-children about. A genuine thumbs up from both of us. I didn't give it the full 5-stars only because of very minor cudda-shudda's, such as no title formatting on the DVD and a wee bit high on the prices for the photo prints. I have video editing software, and it was easy to make up a spiced up version of the video to present to family and friends. 

A hat's-off to all the lovely people in Las Vegas who, when hearing we just got married, were so enthusiastic in their wishes for us. This experience was way more fun than I ever anticipated.",11,0,9

They can range from mildly uncomfortable and headache-inducing (due to the clicking, clacking, and jack-hammering sounds) to ones that have left me shaking and crying. 

SimonMed in Scottsdale has been the best experience by far. I was able to get an appointment before 7:00 AM, so I could be to work on time. The waiting room is very nicely decorated and completely spotless. The dressing rooms are super large and have a laundry basket, bench, chair, TV, and some toiletries. You actually get scrubs to wear rather than dignity robbing open gowns. It's the little touches like these that can make all the difference as to how comfortable you feel going in. And that in turn makes the time you must spend perfectly still in a tiny tube easier.

The staff was all friendly, but my tech was completely awesome. I wish I could remember his name. He spoke to me like an adult, gave me headphones tuned to the radio station of my choice, told me exactly what scans were coming and when I would be injected with contrast solution. He also performed the injection perfectly so that there was almost no pain, virtually no blood, and zero bruising afterward. He asked about my previous MRI experiences, and when I told him about my worst one, he said he could do the same scan in 1\/2 the time. 

I know I will need to continue to get MRI's, and I sincerely hope that I will be able to keep getting them at SimonMed. They are total professionals in a state-of-the-art and comfortable environment. Highly recommended for all of your health scanning needs.",7,1,5

Being someone who loves flavorful food I was wholly disappointed in my grilled cheese with avocado and tomato on a pretzel roll and tomato & ginger soup.  Granted, none of these ingredients is spicey but my entire meal was just too bland for words.  Admittedly this same meal at Melt could be described as having too much sodium, but you've got to have at least a little flavor to even be considered for a second try.  

As a side note, I also tried my friend's grilled cheese sandwich and it was similarly lacking in flavor.

On the positive side their Chinese cookies are absolutely amazing.  And this is my favorite type of cookie so I tend to be highly critical when it comes to taste testing them.

I'll go back because I haven't tried the salads and the vegan chocolate torte and plus I love supporting the local guys.  But I was so bummed that my meal was so bland.

On the plus side, if you have friends that like very plain, unspicey food, this place is a great spot to take them!",0,0,0

Yorkdale is a mall where I like to shop, sometimes. It isn't my #1 place but it has some points going for it. Number one, they have ample free parking. This is amazing. Getting here is quite easy and convenient and it has a Moxie's (drinks and food at this location SUCKS), a Pickle Barrel (I haven't been to the Y-dale one yet, but I like PB), and a movie theatre where you can go watch a movie after shopping. The Indigo\Starbucks here is a very nice one, and the hand dryers in the bathroom are th coolest in the city (seriously....in the women's in Indigo, anyway).

It has a good selection of some of my favourite stories including Miss Sixty, Crate & Barrel, Sunglass Hut and Sephora and Browns and Roots as well. They have a lot of children's shops and clothes for younger people which is appealing since, well, I'm not old. The mall is big and pleasant looking with an upscale feeling to it. 

Negative:
I don't know if it is just me but I hate mall rats. I don't mind couples and families shopping, but like 6 or 8 shrieking, loud teens in garishly horrid clothing and demeanour running amok in the mall always puts a damper on things. You can find them by the theatres too. On the weekends, I usually have to squeeze past and knock over a few tweens to buy a drink or get into the show rooms. The drone of tween noise is excruciating.

Customer service here isn't great either. I've never had outstanding customer service at any store, despite making purchases. The food court is horrendou and always busy. I'm grateful for the addition of Booster Juice at least, but other than that, I'd rather just not. Yorkdale Mall is refreshing and cool when visited upon once every 2-3 months. 

PS. The mall should also think about getting a bank set up here--preferably a BMO. A mall without any banking services in or nearby is frustrating whenever someone needs one. Other than the two TD ATMs by the Shoppers, you have nothing. I think a bank should be set up in a central area of the mall, preferably near the most expensive shops like Tiffany and Holts where it's probably needed.",5,0,2
fl53H0FrOVlpzH26GSCwAw,RiEo6fAuvM-3D6mTNtc9FQ,uanCi4OGc1mHLGl_AT4JhQ,2,2012-08-28,"I was debating hard on what to rank TI...Gonna call this a 2.49...I went with this low rating for a few reasons I will name later but also came up with it because I have never ever once won a nickel at the tables or on the machines at this casino! So I may be a tad prejudiced with this review!! 

Well here goes my thoughts on this place. This place is so hit or miss!!! The line to check in ...SUCKS ..almost always takes forever unless you are on a com'd deal , then its fantastic because the players club line is almost always empty!! The pool area, just is not all that great .   C+ in my book.  I have always had inconsistent service here even though the waitresses outfits do help the frustration of having to wait for a cocktail.  The daybeds to lay on run about $35 during the week, not bad. 

The rooms here are nice. The beds have always been nice. My rooms have had a frig in them , which is virtually a no-no anymore in Vegas! Well a frig where you can actually store things anyway. 

The casino floor stinks. I hate the layout completely.  The dealers here are like robots. Just boring! I cant tell you how many times I have seen almost no one even at the tables. The siren show that starts at night is fine. Begins about every 90 minutes. The girls are beautiful and its fun to see ..ONCE(well maybe twice)...then its complete boredom. Their long running show Mystere is very good, but its time to bring in something new. I mean how many times can you see these circus shows, especially the same one? You can get really good room\/show deals though if you have never seen Mystere, look on the website for TI and stay during the week! 

The restaurants at TI are pricey and very inconsistent. Senor Frogs is not good at all while Kahunaville(coupons galore) is not bad and the party bar next door is a blast and the only night spot in this place that seems to get carried away!! Shots are flying there!! Gilleys has always been boring when we have been and the food beyond overpriced for what you get.  The Breeze Bar near the entrance is hit or miss as well, but sometimes late gets really going. The coffee shop is good for breakfast but of course way overpriced. $15 for eggs bacon and coffee. Phils Steakhouse is very average for the money. Its expensive and one would think you would leave with your mouth begging for more. Not the case here. Portobella starter good, French onion soup not bad, Filet ok, crab good, lobster not cooked right, Halibut just very average...It was not bad overall  but for $105 each....umm...it should be a hell of alot better! 

This casino runs quite a few specials. LOOK for them online or make sure you are signed up for their players club! They run specials for locals often too. I would never pay up to stay at TI, but I guess if I get it for free up to $70. I would consider it for the price and location. Dont forget they whack you for a very expensive resort fee. Anyway dont let one of the Sirens of TI throw you off the plank here ...or come to think of it  maybe getting captured by them isnt such a bad idea and would make your rating rise to a much higher level!!

There is a door between the bar area and the quiet dining room which was great. Always nice to be able to have a conversation!

The Cornish hen was moist and flavourful and the onions that came with it were amazing as well! Definitely recommend. The bison had an interesting taste (and the chipotle mustard was incredible!). The dish was enjoyed but the sweet potato side was nothing to write home about. The black cod and the striploin are also highly recommended.

Came for the apple pancake cuz it's been years since we've had it.  Also ordered the chorizo & cheese omelette.  We're going to split these two entrees so it is going to be more than enough.
Coffee is good.  Limited soda selection so my dining guest ordered the strawberry lemonade which gets one free refill.

They do NOT take credit card, it's cash only and for your convenience (?) they have an ATM available.  Seriously, why pay credit card processing fees when you can collect money by making an ATM machine available.  :-p

The omelette WAS yummy, the pancake was pretty good but I actually needed to use a tiny bit of syrup for each bite cuz it seemed to lack the intensity I had remembered.  Must be aging brain cells.

Service picked up once our waitress finally took our order.  
It seems there are plenty of regulars that visit this place.

Heads up on the parking.  It seems as if the parking space is kind of lacking.  It looked as if customers have to park in the street it the small lot is full.

Been here for both breakfast and lunch.  Breakfast was bad, lunch was good, and I need to increase the sample size if I want to possibly up the rating here.

On this last visit I ordered the Brooklyn chop salad with a side of house made potato chips.  The chips were quite good.  And the salad was one of the better salads I've had.  Romaine, radicchio, olives, sun dried tomatoes, pistachios, salami.  The salad was not over-dressed and the mix of textures and tastes was good.  My friend ordered the Derby salad which I had a bite of.  It was fine - both salads were quite fresh.  He asked for his dressing on the side so his salad was also not over-dressed.  I would definitely come back here for the salads.

It's breakfast that really lowers this rating to just okay.  Ordered the chilaquiles and was sorely disappointed.  The serving was tiny, just a small handful of chips, that has been soaked through by the time they were served.  The sauce was underwhelming.  The egg was the only thing that partially saved the dish.  I vowed never to order it again.

Anyways, the burger. Got the smoke shack. Decent quality ingredients that rivals your typical quality grill joint. Best? No. Decent? Yes. I did like the sport peppers that they had though. Long, thin peppers that are similar to peppercinis in flavor. 

The standout for me were the fries. Crinkle fries that were crispy throughout and not too potatoey. Loved them. 

Outside of that, I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll be craving this so this likely won't be on the destination list when we're back in Vegas. So many other food options to try here.",0,0,0

So we heard about this place opening up, and since I'm Indian, I'm always looking for good Indian restaurants around Charlotte. We decided to go here on a stormy evening for dinner. The decor was nice, which made me think ""oh wow, an upscale Indian restaurant."" Upscale my foot! The only thing upscale about this place is the decor and prices and it stops at that. Overpriced mediocre food, some less than average, and some misleading.

Also, it makes me laugh when non-Indians call this place ""authentic."" Keep reading to find out why.

Looking at the menu, I found palak paneer, marked at $14. Um, what?? It should NOT cost over $9 unless it has gold flakes mixed in or something. Pieces of paneer (firm cottage cheese) cooked in spinach puree - why does this have to cost $14? I can cook it for 10 people for a lower price than that! Fail #1

Next, I asked the server what kind of noodles they used for the hakka noodles. He said ""thick noodles like spaghetti."" No, no, no, no... I have grown up in India and Indo-Chinese cuisine is my favorite in the world. Using spaghetti for that is a disgusting insult. Hakka noodles are supposed to be thin noodles, made with Angel Hair or something like it. Fail #2

The dessert section had totally non-Indian things like Tiramisu and Apple crumble. Get your shit right, you are running an Indian restaurant. I expect to see desserts like gulabjamun, rasgulla, gajar halwa and kulfi, maybe some Indian flavors of ice cream. I don't go to an Indian restaurant to eat cheesecakes and creme brulees. Fail #3

We went over the menu again and decided to order chilli shrimp for appetizers since the description on their menu looked authentic. From their menu: ""Shrimp flavored with soy sauce, vinegar, ginger-garlic paste, sauteed with jalapenos, green peppers and chilli sauce."" This is what arrived to our table: Shrimp in really hot RED sauce, no jalapenos, no soy sauce, and, wait for it... CURRY LEAVES! Did I mention HOT? I'm Indian and this was hot even for my taste buds! Let me tell you something, dear friends at Curry N Kabab House... I make this thing at home, and even a spoonful of soy sauce gives this a lovely dark brown color. It's not supposed to be red, and should not have curry leaves. In fact nothing in Indo-Chinese food should have curry leaves so get rid of that! Fail#4

Then came the Tandoori chicken. The chicken was not well marinated and I kept thanking my stars for the mint chutney that came with it, because without it the chicken wouldn't have been palatable. Also, the essence of Tandoori chicken is in the drumsticks. A single Google image search for ""tandoori chicken"" will show you pieces of chicken drumsticks, marinated with ginger-garlic paste and red chilli powder and grilled. Our tandoori chicken came out sizzling hot, without a single drumstick, and yes, without any flavor. Also, bright orange food color? So tacky... Get rid of it, it's 2013! Fail#5

Lastly (thank God) the lamb biryani. It had so much masala, I was sure this would be good. Wrong. It completely lacked flavor. It amazes me how someone can fuck up biryani but still make it look good. In fact, it amazes me how a restaurant can call itself ""upscale,"" have everything overpriced, and still manage to not make a single thing on the menu right. And to think we spent $40 here for two. Shame on you Currey N Kabab House, Your restaurant sucked just as much as your other one, Curries and Cakes. You are the biggest Indian food failure in all of Charlotte.",8,6,0

We went here on a Monday night, around 7 P.M.  There were trays that had looked like they had been sitting under those heat lamps since the opening of the restaurant (such as the crawfish whose sauce had a scummy membrane on top of it).  

There was a decent variety of sushi at the sushi station.  However, it also looked VERY old and dried out, and some of the nigiri sushi fish layers had been removed by an unknown patron, leaving just a few mounds of rice.  

Like many Americanized Chinese buffets, there is a plethora of battered, fried, chicken covered with an unctuous sweet sauce.  Ocean Buffet is no exception.  Today they had ""Lover's chicken"" (AKA sweet and sour chicken), orange chicken, honey chicken... all very sweet and slightly different tasting from the other dish.  

In terms of seafood, they have crab legs here, but they looked a bit too puny and skinny for me to try them out.  They also have raw oysters, various incarnations of shrimp, some mussel dishes, and baked salmon. 

Soup was decent, probably the tastiest part of the meal.  I tried some hot and sour soup, and egg drop soup, which both had good flavor and texture.

Service was good.  Old plates were removed promptly and drinks refilled as needed.  

Price?  A little under $11 (10.79 I think, something like that) which includes soft drinks.",2,0,0

They are really friendly, but the guy overcharged me 50cents for the drink. Not a big deal, so I overlooked it. I must have waited almost 30min for my take out and they weren't super busy - that's ok, I was sure the pho was super delicious therefore worth the wait. BUT, when I got home, and opened the rice with bbq meat takeout box, I felt gypped. It was such a small portion for $8, and the three meat pieces were really really thin and tasted tough and dry.

There were some slices of potato and some pieces of chopped bacon, but they looked sparse sitting in the thin, somewhat-cheesy, creamed soup base.

It's hard to make a Caesar salad bad, though.  But you can ""wow"" it by having thick creamy full-of-flavor dressing instead of the runny, bland stuff.

- flirtea, jazzie boba, hug size

pros:
- boba was pretty consistent, only a couple of hard pieces
- the black milk tea was good, i should've asked for it less sweet
- there aren't many places in north scottsdale that sell boba. and the ones that do sell boba, suck balls. so props for opening one up

cons:
- the clusterf of a menu
- i feel like a douche ordering, ""hi, id like a flirtea totoro jazzie boba, hug sized jigglypuff please!""
- $4.31 for 1\/2 cup of milk tea and 1\/2 cup of boba. get rekt. i realize that rent is expensive at fashion square but the value is horrible",1,3,1
Bc7zfTPjipt288ihtbEe5w,EC5TGpxONfz4IZIjML0DpQ,tGBeFfwXCUZOsb0YWiMWIA,4,2013-01-09,"I used to like Ka Chi. I really did. 

In fact, the locale in the Annex used to be the Korean restaurant of choice I used take noobies to expose them to the greatness that is Korean cuisine. 

However, the Korean town location has started to slide a bit over the last couple of years. The quality is simply not as good and since I have had better since I really do not go to that location anymore. 

For example, more than once I have found the Pork Bone Soup to be undercooked -- by that I mean the meat is still firmly attached to the bone and thus you find yourself having to wrestle with your meal and you know you can't splash pork bone soup. Since once even a spot falls on your clothes, that stuff is simply not coming off. That is just a pork bone soup no-no. 

However, on a recent trip to Chinatown... I was going to Seor Ak San for Korean however once there, we found the place closed. Bummer. 

I knew of *THIS* Ka Chi from before and after opting to go in here instead of the Korean restaurant literally next door to this one, I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. 

Yes, the place is lacking some sort of central heating and it feels a bit damp, but the food was good and satisfying. The banchan were varied and delicious and even though the motherly waitress\owner seemed to be serving and cleaning tables at warp speed, she was never busy enough to ask if we wanted a banchan refill or if we needed anything, like more tea in a more than friendly manner.

My date and I ended up chatting it up for a bit and not once did we feel rushed, nor did they try to sneak in the tab. 

Finally, we left as the place started getting packed and we felt it unfair to have them loose business because we were using up a table. 

Yup, we felt that good about our stay that we wanted to help them out. That says something. 

If I want to go back to Ka Chi, I will come back to this one locale.",7,1,4

It's a nice enough place but given the staff, patrons and menu's it would be damn near impossible to visit this place WAA (Without Asian Assistance). Thank goodness I was with a crew of seasoned Shanghai foodie vets (Jen K and Wayne). 

The feast we attacked was a monster with many courses and one of the differences between Shanghai style cuisine and other areas of China that I really enjoyed was their use of steamed buns instead of rice or noodles.

Here is a rundown of our Chinese Winter Solstice Eat Up (according to menu #):

D1 Shanghai Baked Special Whole Chicken $36.00 (aka Beggar's Chicken) 
- This was incredible as it requires an order ahead of time so to bake inside a bread like shell for 7 hours. The result was fall off the bone meat. well seasoned

D8 Special Deep Fried Duck $26.00
- Far and away my fave part of the meal. The 1\/2 duck was deep fried and diced, the seasoning and the way it was cooked eliminated the overly gamey taste of the duck letting it's more delicious flavour qualities shine.

C7 Braised Shredded Eel $18.99
- This meal sounds more intense then it was. The Eel (when you could find a piece) was good and the sauces it sat in were good but I found this to be more filler (veggies and the like) then eel. 

C13 Sweet and Sour Boneless Whole Yellow Fish $23.99
- I could take this meal or leave it. The whole fish tasted lovely and the veggies combined with the orange sauce gave it a bright colour. However, not being a fan of Chinese Take-out style sweet and sour sauce (which essentially was what it reminded me of) ruined this dish. Less sauce or sauce on side next time and this would be a winner.

F2 Dong Po Meat Lotus Leaf Wrapped $10.99
- I really enjoyed this dish. Pork Belly with giant Bok Choi veggies. Delicious. Protip, you have to take a whole piece not just the meat layer the fat and sinew make each mouthful a party!

J1 A LA House Special Fried Rice Cake with Pork $10.99
- Don't recall this meal - therefore I assume it was forgettable. If this was the meal with glutenous rice (which I believe it was) there is no meat in this dish so don't think you are getting any. Blahhh... bland... had a spoonful to try (not a fan).

M1 Crispy Deep Fried Banana with Honey   $8.99
- This was AMAZING!!! Banana coated in molten sugar needing to be cooled in a vat of cold water at the table. Crystallized sugar and banana made this a fave dessert which I plan on attempting to make on my own. YUMMM!

M3 Deep Fried Egg White Ball with Mashed Sesame (4) $6.99
- shudder. what a horrible way to end my meal. Eggy buns deep fried and coated in sugar injected with hot sesame paste (black). Just unpleasant for me all the way around. 

Next time I'd rather save room for more Duck and Pork Belly.

1st attempt - delivery driver was out sick, ok, order to go. After 20 min, I arrive to my order not complete.  I then receive my sandwich and get it home, they got my order wrong.  How do you mess up an order - add everything except hot peppers?  They charged me for everything.   I was the only one in the store, so they weren't busy.  Oh well, I still enjoyed my sandwich.

2nd attempt - another call for delivery.  The representative on the phone didn't know if they delivered ( it's in giant letters across the window.) So the ""manager"" gets on saying they have a min order, which was different from previous attempts I have made, when questioned about the increase he stated that the policy was changed 2 years ago.  Followed by he started a few months ago.  When I then asked how did he know the policy changed years ago having just started, he seemed befuddled by someone calling him on the misinformation.

Store # 6422, Fashion Square Mall, Scottsdale, Arizona.Tonight was the worst experience ever there!  I am a regular Zara Customer having shopped in Chicago, California, and Arizona locations for 8 years now.  This evening, I was shopping in the store for a total of 20 minutes from start to finish.  From the moment I walked trough the door this evening, not one sales associate said a word to me.  No one helped us!  My daughter and I made quick selections for her to try on because we needed something specific, and she headed towards the dressing room.  It was 8:57 at that moment, when the cashier, Maria Marte, was the first person in the entire time I was there to say anything to me.  Here is what she said, ""We are closed.""  I replied, ""Its 3 minutes to closing, you aren't closed yet, my daughter wants to try 3 blouses on, and then we should be able to make a purchase quickly.""  The cashier at Zara, Fashion Square replied to me, ""Well I'm closing my register.""  

At 9:02 pm, the cashier Maria Marte turned to me and said, ""I'm closing my register."".  I said in return, ""We are going to make a purchase, my daughter is finishing up in the dressing room.""  Where in she stated, ""Well we are closed.""  I said, ""You won't let us make a purchase?""  Maria the cashier then said, ""Well my manager said to go ahead and close my register.""  I asked to speak to the store manager, because this didn't seem right. It was no way to treat a customer who is trying to make a purchase at 2 minutes after 9:00 pm

At that moment, the assistant store manager came over to us.  His name is Ruben Sanchez.  Ruben turned to me and said, ""We are closed.""  I said, I realize this, but we are about to make a purchase.  He then said, ""Well our registers are closing.""  I looked at my watch and said, ""It's 4 minutes after, won't you give us some grace and let us make a purchase?""  Ruben the assistant store manager at the Scottsdale, AZ store turned to the cashier and said, ""Close it down.""  Then walked away from me.  I said to Maria the Cashier, ""I come 9 years out of Retail Sales, and have worked for Nordstrom and Barney's New York.  This is never an attitude that a sales associate should have towards a customer that would like to make a purchase.  Generally, at 9:00 pm closing you close the front door, but let any customers still in the store at that time finish out their transaction, make the purchase, then allow them to leave.  This is within a reasonable amount of time, it's 9:06 now.""  Maria the cashier then said, ""Well my manager told me to close the register.""  I replied, ""Even if that means you won't allow me to make a purchase.""  She said, ""Yes.""  After begging them to take my money, I finalized my transaction at 9;06 pm, with purchasing a white blouse my daughter had selected.  I don't think I could ever shop at the Zara Scottsdale, Arizona ever again.  They treated me so meanly and made me feel as though I was being kicked out, when all I was doing was buying a blouse and being a loyal customer.",7,10,1

They do not serve alcohol, but it's a BYOB situation. I think they charged us like $10 corkage.  Totally worth it.  Stop by and pick up a great bottle of wine and prepare for a top-notch meal.  

I'll attach photos of our plates.  You can see the care taken in every plate.  At the end of the evening the chef came out and was taking time at every table to introduce herself--a nice touch.

Also ordered the spicy chicken wings, which with a honey sauce, fondly reminded me of the similarly-sweet wings I grew up eating. They were also decently sized and very crispy, both key parts to good wings. The pork ramen had good accompaniments, but I found you get more noodles, meat and broth at Kinton Ramen. Unlike most other ramen places that just have the traditional spicy chili flakes, it was nice to have some Sriracha at the table to add spice at my desire.

When I visited them last month, I was expecting something great from Thomas Keller.  I was pleased with the food, but I was a bit disappointed with the waitress that we had (reason to receive 4 stars instead of 5).  The timing for the different courses were completely off.  The appetizer came before they opened our bottle of wine.  And the entree came before I finished our appetizer.  However, the quality of food made up for the lack of proper service.  

The dish that is memorable is the smoke salmon appetizer.  They serve it in a tight-sealed jar with croutons.  While opening our wine, the sommelier made a great suggestion to use mustard with the dish.  If interested, see the picture that I posted.  By the way, their bread, as simple as it is, is one of the best.

GAP is still the same price but the variety and quality have declined.

At least at this location though, there is a lot of stuff. The store is huge, the price cuts are huger. I came in a bit worried I wouldn't find my most favorite work business casual pants but I did.

Had an al pastor and shrimp burrito because I wanted to get crazy. The meat is so tender and juicy, the burrito fillings all hit the right spots and they melt the cheese on the tortilla before making the burrito. It's great. 

If you don't know any better you'd be confused by the ordering system, as there are different stations for different items. I'm sure they'll figure out a better way to do this, but there's not just not one big line, there's a crowd of ravenous humans grouped up trying to figure out which meat or taco station they're supposed to be at so they can fill their fat faces. 

The salsa bar, which houses 7 or 8 different sauces\/salsas, is great. I'm a sauce kind of guy. I like to try many different salsas on my meal, so thank you for saucing me up. The salsa bar also houses cucumbers, pickled carrot\/jalapeños, but my favorite part is the fact they have their grilled onions and jalapeños refilled here instead of ordering behind the counter.

Last but not least I also had elote which is the mexican street style corn on the cob, mayo, cotija cheese and chili pepper. I don't think I would come here and not order that. Although the other location when I went had the white corn(which I prefer), this location had yellow corn, but good nonetheless.

This location also has a bar. 
Aesthetically, this location could use some work, as I'm not sure what they're going for. By no means does it look bad, just needs work and nothing that can't easily be fixed. Ultimately, I don't go to places because they look cool, it's all about the food and Taco y Taco delivers.

Pretty standard fare for a festival, in fact.  They have taken over not only the symphony park area, but the parking lot next door.

While that may sound like a lot of wine, you also need to understand that there are a ton of people who are wanting to partake.  And by partake, I mean drink.  And by drink, I mean as much at they can.

My man Will mentioned the lack of attendees waiting your turn, and even the tents providing a less than ideal tasting experience, and I would have to agree on both counts.

Generally the crowds around the tasting tents are clamoring for any drop of anything they can get rather than appreciating anything, while those pouring are not doing much more than trying to satiate the crowds.

There are exceptions - some wineries would try to offer you the full breadth of their stable.  But they are few and far between.  And for the ticket price and sample size, you are not going to get your drink on here.",1,0,0

Due to an event I was a part of, I had to meet my party at the restaurant about 15 minutes after they had gotten there.

It took our waiter five minutes before he saw me and came to ask for my order. 

I decided to order the Blueberry Kale Salad ($11) and added shrimp ($6). What came to me was a small salad with only a few, small pieces of fruit and four, yes, FOUR shrimp. They were not large, jumbo prawns. They were rather small, and at $1.50 each shrimp I was not happy. The salad was just not worth the $11, even though it did have what I can only call ""fair"" flavor.

I kind of got used to that in Eastern Europe and other undeveloped and partially civilized parts of the world credit cards are not accepted. No vendor trusts them, is willing to pay credit card companies for the fee, or can wait a month to get their money. Cash only, mainly, or when card is accepted, it has to be debit card where there can be effectively no post-sale disputes and the transaction is instantaneous and final. I never thought this level of anti-consumerism will be found in the USA. 

Guess what, Arco's gas station on Decatur (I have not been to their other locations and after this will never be) has a ""debit card only"" policy. I couldn't believe it. I tried my credit card anyway and it surely wouldn't work (machine asking for a PIN). Normally I would just drive off when I see something as outrageous and offensive. But since my car was really out of gas and it's Thanksgiving and people were waiting in the car and we wanted to get home as soon as possible, I decided to use my debit card. Then it gave me the choice of no transaction or a $0.35 cash\/ATM fee if I really wanted to get gas. 

In other words not only are they unwilling to pay credit card fees to make the transaction friendlier and more convenient for you, they in fact force you to use your debit card AND tack on a nice mandatory fee ON YOU.

With Trump's antisocial and anti-consumer value system taking hold, I am afraid we will be seeing more of such kind of outrageous practices. Until then, avoid this place.",1,0,0

The service was friendly, but they failed to inform us that brown rice is an additional $3\/person! Mouth dropping upcharge. When our bill arrived, we informed them of our concern, and they kindly only charged us for one brown rice. Sadly, having to pay $6 for both me and my husband to enjoy brown rice will probably prevent us from returning.

Even so, I can say that the red curry is a fine specimen of curry. The server recommended the massaman, but it is not available as a lunch special. The chicken and rice soup was a bit salty; the egg roll was simply ok, and the fried wonton is just an odd item to me without at least some variety of filling.

Super fancy looking place with chandeliers and fancy teacups...a nice experience =) very different from the places I'm used to in sauga. 

There's some items that I wouldn't normally find on a menu where I live so it was a nice change. Everything was so yummy! What I like about this place is that the food is cooked to order and not on a cart with someone pushing it around for hours until someone orders it! 

Portions are fairly big (the size of the har gow, shui mai and custard buns were bigger than what I'm used to). Flavours are great and you can tell that everything is made fresh! Their sauces for dipping on the side were so good! Their chili oil and peanut sauce were on point

After walking in and quickly realizing how fancy it was, I kinda expected the dimsum to be better than it was. Still great and better than average BUT not as great and fancy as the place looks! 

Would definitely come back!",1,0,1

On one hand, they relatively inexpensive bentos considering they have huge portions that are easily customizable. (Can't beat an average of $10 per bento!) On the other hand, I always eat more that I should here and because the food is so heavy I end up regretting it in the end. They have preset combinations but I always make my own. You can do a 2 item or 3 item combo and each comes with your selection of rice, your chosen entrees, Mac salad, and 2 sauces. The garlic chicken, mochiko chicken and furikake shrimp are stand outs in the menu. You can choose their house fried rice, white rice, brown rice, or make your own. The kimchi friend rice is one of their offerings and it had a pretty good flavor but it's way too oily\/greasy.

We tried to make reservations ahead of time, but could not get through to someone on the phone when we called. We arrived at 7ish and decided on a 3rd floor bay- $75 plus a ridiculous $5 membership fee per person. The price list when you arrived stated all the ""walk-in"" pricing. So, I informed the woman who was taking our reservation that we tried to call ahead, blah blah blah and I was frustrated that now we were stuck paying walk - in pricing. She explained that Top Golf does not accept reservations and the ""walk-in pricing"" is their only price. Then why not just call it the price....  But whatever, we decided to play and have some fun. My father-in-law was assured that all clubs, balls and gloves would be available to us in our bay, included in the fee. He was pleased because he did not have his gloves with him. 

After you make your reservation you wait for a host to take you to your bay. The place is beautiful, brand new and the bars on the 3rd floor were awesome. We got to the bay and the hostess proceeded to speak so fast that we had trouble figuring everything out. I was with my husband and in-laws, and the music was so loud that they could not hear her explanations. Getting set up on the computer system was another annoyance. Again, it was loud and we are all huddling around a small computer to give our personal information. Seemed very inefficient. 

Finally, we got set up on the computer and were ready to play. But no gloves - the host explained that gloves could be purchased at the store for $15 a pair. Wtf. We were told not even 10 minutes earlier that they were included..... 

Then, our server came to give us the whole menu schpiel and ask for a credit card to keep the tab open. We only played for a hr because of the expense and she must have come to our bay more than half a dozen times asking if we wanted food\/drinks. Her interruptions took away from our hour of play and it began to get very annoying! There should be a call button for bar service. I don't need someone babysitting me.

$100 poorer and an hour later, we left. It was a fun experience once we figured out the games, but the service and the organization leaves a lot to be desired. In a place like Vegas where service is everything, this place is lacking.",2,0,0

The layout of the restaurant is cramped. If you are seated at the front of the restaurant like we were, you will be within two feet of anyone else trying to be seated. With large parties, this quickly becomes an exercise in how to avoid looking like a fool while scarfing down all of the Taj's delicious food. The cramped feeling is also felt due to the lack of spacing between tables. This is presumably to increase the seating count, but really, I think the experience could be improved by eliminating two tables.

Getting to the buffet from any table is tricky, again due to the cramped layout of the tables. The entry and exit point from the buffet line is at the same spot, and navigating with both a full plate and a child is not really possible unless you are a professional juggler.

Finally, service is average to sub-par. Our water glasses were refilled once. Perhaps this is to encourage a quick meal, but when eating such spicy food, better service should be rendered. I assume there would be a better experience during non-peak times.

I ordered one order of the thai chicken fried rice which includes your standard thai ingredients: rice, carrots, peas, egg, chicken, etc... plus pineapples and cashews. I was thinking, ""pineapples and cashews... I love pineapples and cashews in my rice (reminds me of home)."" I was saddened to find my plate contained no pineapples and cashews and brought it up with the server. 

That's when the funk experience happened.... I tell the server (we'll call her server A) that my dish has no pineapples and cashews. She looks lost for a moment. The server walks to the back and looks at the menu and brings it up to one of her other coworkers (whom we'll identify as server B).. Server A comes back and says we have no pineapples. I tell her I should've been told this prior to receiving my order. Server A goes back again to talk with Server B. Then I see Server B walk to the kitchen and comes back with a can to open it. ""The can looks like a can of pineapples"" I think to myself. She walks back to the kitchen... and sure enough comes back with a serving of cold pineapples and fresh cashews to go into the fried rice.

Frustration kicks in for me.

Now... I've had pineapple fried rice back home in Sacramento.... and pineapple and cashews can also be fried into the rice...... hot pineapples go much better with fried rice than cold pineapples. I get the sense these people don't know what they're doing and cancel my order altogether telling them to take the plate away.

Server A appears slightly panicked and walks to the back to talk with her server B (again). They look at the menu.... talk... and then comes back to tell me I wasn't told to include the cashews and pineapples in the order. (really?) We go over the menu together. There's no indication in the menu that I have to request these to have it in the order. She sees what I see as I call her bluff. She apologizes.

The experience doesn't end there. At the end they still include the rice in the bill even though I didn't eat my dish, told them to take it away, and told them to take it off the bill because I didn't eat it.

However I must say that IN-N-Out has defied the odds and continues to impress me with the way they run their business. Friendly employees, fresh food, and great service are the reasons I continue to visit there (even though I loathe Metrocenter overall). Think about this; they dispatch a person outside to take orders if the drive thru line is too long to make sure your order gets in and you don't leave frustrated.

Really. 

Would ANY other place do that? Not a chance. Also, out of all the times I have been there, they have NEVER gotten my order wrong. I am a bit picky with my food and I never have to worry, I can trust them to get it right the first time. The employees are CLEARLY paid better wages than other burger joints which means something to me as well. They are happy to be there (for the most part) and this is evident in the level of service they provide. 

My ONLY, and I mean only critique of this In-N-Out Burger location is the shall we say, interesting, way the drive thru is set up. Series of cones to direct you in and when you get out you are in a parking lot of Burlington Coat Factory with many people (usually) walking in the lot. Other than that, this place is a great place to stop in and grab a burger.

So this guy James L was driving up from Phoenix (yeah) for our first date (double yeah) on Saturday. I'm not too into planning dates, because, well, that's not my job as a woman. James hadn't been to Nevada so he wasn't much good as to picking out a Vegas restaurant for us, so we compromised - he'd pick the cuisine and I'd pick the restaurant. He chose middle eastern food and so my search was on. Now Vegas isn't really known for its delicious middle eastern food so it was a bit of a search trying to find a place that wasn't just a spot serving Kronos gyros and mint tea. Some girls I met earlier that day at a meetup.com hike I was on suggested Marrakech.

Well, my date picked me up at 5 and we headed on out to Vegas (because I live in Henderson.) So I've driven past this restaurant about a zillion times but I had no idea what the name was. I thought it was in the same shopping center as Ferraro's but in actuality, it's a little further down the street. After getting turned around and driving on the highway and turning back around, we found the place.

I literally knew nothing about the restaurant other than it was Moroccan, which isn't quite middle eastern but it's really similar - or just enough so that it doesn't much matter for this reviewer. We went inside and were asked if we had a reservation - we didn't, and they sat us anyway, which wasn't a problem because the place was pretty empty. The place was cool - definitely an awesome spot for a first date. The tent like atmosphere is different, it's very dark, so you don't have to worry about looking busted (not that either of us looked busted, actually, it was the exact opposite) because candle light makes everybody 10X better looking. It also makes stealing long kisses easier because you don't feel as if you're being watched by a thousand pairs of peering eyes. 

We were seated in a corner in front of a tiny little table. Be forewarned, I'm 5'9 and James is 6'4 so the leg room is a teeny bit cramped but nothing too tough. A waiter washed our hands and gave us each a terry rag to dry off our hands and to use as a napkin. I'm a fan of rose water so that was fun for me. 

James and I were given a wine menu but we didn't order any booze and we weren't offered whatever free bottle of wine everybody else is talking about. No biggie. We were told it was a prefix menu so... yeah. That's about it. We were asked if we had food allergies, which neither of us had and they brought out the food. 

Hmmmm... I'm not sure how ""Moroccan"" shrimp scampi and bread topped with sesame seeds is, but it was good. It was nothing mind blowing, I mean, it's a dish I made every day after school when I was in the 7th grade - butter, shrimp, garlic and parsley. 

The next was the lentil soup, which was bleh. Michelle M.'s review is right on the money; (including her position on the belly dancer) the soup tasted like canned soup. *Tears*

The crudité plate was good. The picked beets were a nice touch. I wish I would have known we could have taken food to go before they whisked it away to bring out the next course. 

The next was the beef kabob and we each got a weirdly tough piece of meat per skewer. It wasn't the greatest but it wasn't a big deal. 

We didn't eat any of the couscous and dark meat chicken dish - I ended up having it three days later (because we found out from a nice blonde waitress that we could get our food to go) and it was so bland. 

The dessert was decent - I liked that it had walnuts and we ended up taking 98% of it to go.

Honestly, the food left something to be desired,  but the atmosphere was good. I definitely don't think they food was worth the $100 bill he threw down before we left but nonetheless, I enjoyed myself. James could have taken me to the city dump and I would have had just as good of time with him, because, well, let's be real for a second; he was looking and smelling like heaven. I don't know if this place really deserves three whole stars, but I'll give them the extra one because I had a great time and that's really what it's all about.",4,1,3

As far as TSA agents are concerned, they seem to slightly less rude here than other parts of the country and don't make a huge deal just because you forgot to take a lighter out of your purse.  One must always expect at least some element of irritation with security folks when flying but, from my experience, it is minimal here.  Sure some of the terminals are a little old and could use a bit of a face lift and the food choices aren't top notch, but over all, McCarran airport is a decent place to fly in and out of.",2,0,1

Other patrons gladly shared their opinions of what we should order and so forth. The bartender was was great and obvious was very familiar with nearly all the customers. Although in San francisco at a nice restaurant you can receive good customer service, in the local establishments off the strip there is a different level of service that you get.

After some thinking, I believe this restaurant is short staffed. The hostess was friendly and explained to us that there would be about a 30-45 minute wait so she said she would text us when the table was ready. We decided to walk around and get some Starbucks to pass the time. After no notification, we walked back where the hostess said she had called us twice. She was really sweet and let us sit in a booth upon request. Half of the restaurant was empty so we didn't understand why there was a wait but again, maybe it had something to do with them being a short staffed?

Our waiter came and brought us some waters. We ordered some drinks and after receiving them we didn't see him for awhile. We saw two women from another table bring their receipts to talk to him. I'm assuming some drama went down because it wasn't until another 20 minutes went by that another waiter came and told us he would be taking over. Our food came out 20 minutes later and it was okay. I ordered the Sweet Corn Enchilada. 

The bathroom is upstairs and there is a bathroom attendant. She was very kind, however this made me feel incredibly uncomfortable because I was the only one in there and I didn't have any cash with me to tip. I just feel uncomfortable any time there is a bathroom attendant anywhere honestly.

Arriba Restaurant is part of the Renaissance Hotel, which is attached to Rogers Centre.  Like Rogers Centre, Arriba Restaurant has the kind of modern design that probably felt much more modern years ago.  The best part of Arriba's design is how the glass windows provide diners a perfect view of the stadium; it is like being in a luxury box in the outfield.

For breakfast, Arriba Restaurant offers a breakfast buffet; a la carte breakfast options are also available.  Just seeing the names of the items featured in Arriba's breakfast buffet, it seems like a good deal.  They have several glass dispensers of cereal--both sugary cereals and healthy or at least non-sugary cereals.  For cold items, they have sliced fruit, whole fruit, yogurt, and deli meats.  They also have breakfast pastries, breads, muffins, bagels, English muffins, and a bread of the day like banana bread or zucchini bread.

In terms of their hot options, Arriba offers several items including bacon, sausage links, home fries, baked scrambled eggs, French toast, and oatmeal.  Arriba also has a chef station where you can customize an omelette or get eggs made to order.

While the variety is there at Arriba, the food was just not that good.  The bacon was not too bad though it could have been crispier and less salty.  The sausage links had horribly dry interiors.  The French toast was slightly dry and bland.  Some of the cereal options (like the Frosted Flakes) were a tad stale.

In terms of the positives, I liked their home fries.  Their banana bread was also good.  Their omelette station featured good ingredients like ham, tomatoes, mixed peppers, cheese, onions, mushrooms, and spinach.  The chef did a good job preparing the omelette.  Unfortunately, the egg was a poor quality as the omelette color was wrong; it almost looked liked egg whites.

Service was pleasant but a tad slow.

Prices are too high for the quality of the breakfast offered.

Arriba's breakfast buffet is below average for Marriott brand standards; the only Marriott brand breakfast buffet I would put below this one would be the Marriott I went to located in a rural area just outside of Downtown Madison, Wisconsin.  For Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members, the breakfast buffet is included with the room rate so it is not a bad option for elite members.  However, if breakfast is not included with your room rate at this hotel, I would strongly encourage venturing out of the hotel for a Downtown Toronto breakfast.

This is a difficult area to find parking.  The Renaissance offers valet parking for hotel guests; I am not sure if valet parking is also extended to non-hotel guests.  Their valet parking is expensive.",14,11,13

It was the perfect half way point for everyone. There was 11 of us total 6 adulta 5 kids.  At 4:45 we got put on a waiting list. They said 30 minutes. We finally got seated a hour later.  Our waitress seemed inexperienced.  The way she took our order was just odd.  Many people had to yell across the table. We waited about 30 minutes and then our food came out slowly. 5 meals came out. First mistake was one of the burgers which was suppose to have bbq sause on it did not have any one it.  Ok no big deal.  Our waitress is no were to be found. About 10 minutes goes by and finally the rest of the food comes out. My Aunts steak salad was suppose to be medium well. It was rare and bloody. I got the philly cheese steak with no mushrooms.  It come out with nothing but meat and bun.  We sent both meals back.  About 5 minutes later the food came back. My Aunts steak had been taken off the salad and put back on the grill.  The put back on here salad.  My cheese steak got some cold onions and green peppers thrown on top. Again I went looking for our waitress who was no wear to be found.  So I found a manager.   After explaining everything to him he disappeared for a while.  Finally our waitress came back and told me what he was going to do. Mind you everyone was done eatting at this point.  They wanted to remake meal for me. I said no just take it off my bill so they did and gave everyone 20% off which we would have gotten either way since my husband was in the military and they give a 20% discount.  Then the manager came back over and said he was giving us unlimited play for the rest of the night which he failed to mention it was on non ticket games.

How do you continuously shut the water off for the evenings why wouldn't you fix the issue during the day when most residents are at work or school, but No not the Onnix they shut it off right in time for dinner Genius!!! 

Combine this with the fact that despite my several requests to have the lights around the complex fixed so it's not pitch black when walking the dog at night which would be nice considering the criminal history around the complex I was told that they were not changing the lights because it was to much of a hassle due to the frequency of the bulbs going out, well maybe call up the old Haven management team since they fixed the problem and the lights lasted for a year at least. I think this just goes to the general attitude of the management and office team who have perfected the art of making you the resident feel like you are being rude by placing any type of request in to them....

We were staying near the Royal MIle and had passed by this place on a few walks. Decided to head out to have lunch there. Upon arriving, it was raining (outdoor seating closed) so we were immediately led to the back dining room. A very pleasant, modern space with a wall of glass on one side. Waiter came within a few minutes and got a drink order and an orange juice \/ seltzer mix for the kids.

My wife got a pink froo-froo drink that came in a Martini glass and didn't like it (as usual). I tried it and it was OK...just not her thing. She switched to wine. I got a Hendricks Negroni which was really good and stout if you like bitters. 

Thing 1 and Thing 2 ordered kids penne pasta (not on the menu)....one with just butter and one with a red sauce. Red sauce was a bit weak and flavorless. Wife and I shared a scallop app that was pretty good...had a salad with cilantro and a mayo-based sauce on the side. 

Then came the main courses....wife got the salmon med rare and I got the fish and chips. Salmon was reported as just OK and fish and chips were good except for that English tradition of serving things with mushy peas underneath them. Not too bad of an idea, and I don't have anything against peas, but the they need to have some flavor so that they enhance the dish and this wasn't the case. A bit bland. Tartar sauce accompanying my dish as well as the ""chips"" were tasty. The presentation was very nice here. 

Check was 120 pounds which seemed very steep (hmm....is this about $200 USD!!!! ouch). But, very good service.

Meantime, the waitress did take our food order, including crispy hash browns. 
Finally the coffee arrived with some cream, but was definitely not a tasty coffee. 

After a much longer wait (the restaurant was NOT full at this point), the eggs benedict with crispy hash browns did arrive for me, and the pancakes with blueberry sauce and a lemony mascarpone cheese filling arrived for my husband. We were not offered, or asked if we wanted, ketchup for the hash browns or syrup for the pancakes. The hash browns were cooked as we liked them and the poached eggs were done just right and the belly ham was tasty, but the Hollandaise sauce was very bland (Knorr package sauce is better!). My own hash browns are tastier. 

The pancakes tasted of flour but not much else; the mascarpone filling was only in the very center, so you didn't really taste it until you were halfway through eating the pancakes. The blueberry sauce on top was way too sweet and hardly tasted of blueberries. 

We were asked if we wanted more coffee once; at the very end of the meal, I was asked if I wanted additional coffee, but my husband was not even asked.

We ordered the Cajun roll after asking the register girl's opinion and it came out to ~$25... Most expensive sandwich I've ever purchased. But my girlfriend reasoned that it WAS lobster so I bit the bullet and waited it out. 

MAJOR disappointment! First off, the large size is only 6 inches. 6 INCHES. I could buy 5 Subway foot-longs with the money I spent on this dinky roll! To be fair, it was absolutely stuffed with lobster meat and 3 claws on top but the meat was COLD. I was appalled.

Love to call you out if not a local. We came after a rush around 3:30, so we were seated immediately. We got the the jerk wrap meal which came with hand cut fries and the oxtail meal. If you want heat, ask for the scotch bonnet sauce on the side. Awesome!! (Cleared by sinuses) Refreshing cucumber water to help if you're not into heat. Definitely a local spot.",0,0,0

He answered all my questions and stayed in contact with me throughout the process. His workers know what they're doing and are ""good people"". Completely thorough in their job and their clean-up. Not a piece of trash, nail, roofing tile..nothing! The yard and property looked as if know one had been there at all. Crew were all friendly and worked fast..they didn't F##around. I was extremely happy. Michelle in the office was very nice and helped things flow along..If you're looking for a new roof like I was and just need someone to truse call Stell Roofing",3,1,0
