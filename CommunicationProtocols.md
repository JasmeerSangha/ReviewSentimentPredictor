## Communication strategies
Our team collaborates 100% remotely. The COVID 19 pandemic has created a set of circumstances such that we are not able to meet in person at any point in time during this project. From the get-go, we knew that organization and iron clad communication protocols would be paramount to our success as a team.

We are operating as a pseudo-agile team (since we have no product owner). Each week we swap roles in terms of deliverables preparation; however, we are all deeply involved in group discussions on every decision for every deliverable.

### Verbal communication
We are using the following group chats to communicate in writing:
- Slack (private channel)
- Whatsapp (private group, as contingency for Slack)

We are using Zoom meetings for "in-person" meetings. Most key decisions are made in the Zoom meetings. As well, we divide up the tasks during these meetings.

## Project tracking
To track everything in an intuitive way, tasks are added to the project board on GitHub.

### Process: Unassigned tasks (i.e. collaborative group tasks)
1. Create task card on GitHub project board under "To Do".
2. When work on task begins, move task card to "In Progress".
3. When work is completed, move task card to "Done".

Note: Tasks that are not assigned to anyone in particular are not converted to issues.

### Process Assigned tasks (i.e. individual tasks)
1. Create task card on GitHub project board under "To Do".
2. Convert task to an issue.
3. Assign the issue to the team member.
4. When work on task begins, move task card to "In Progress".
5. Create a branch with the same name as the task to create traceability between task and branch. (This also lets the whole team know where to find this work in the repository without having to ask).
6. Complete the task and commit work to the branch.
7. Create a pull request to merge with the master branch.
8. All team members review the pull request and approve.
9. Merge with master branch.
10. When work is completed (merged to master branch), GitHub will automatically move task card to "Done".

Note: We implemented a 3-person review requirement for merging with the master branch in hopes of preventing merge conflicts. This also ensures that everyone on the team has line of sight as to what is pushed to the master branch.
