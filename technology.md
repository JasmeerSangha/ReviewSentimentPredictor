# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
The following will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis.

- PySpark
- Pandas
- Google Colab


## Database Storage
Google Cloud Postgres is the database we intend to use to store our data. PgAdmin will be the front-end user interface.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn and TensorFlow are the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. We will run our initial model using Naive Bayesian. To demonstrate which model best fits this project, we will run a few other models to display their comparisons.

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Neural Network

## Dashboard
The following are potential options for our dashboard. 


| |Description|
|-|-----------|
|Option 1| HTML, CSS, Boostrap for front-end with D3.js integration. Hosted on GitHub Pages.|
|Option 2| Flask with D3.js integration. Hosted on Heroku.|
|Option 3| Google App Engine.|

## Factors

The following problems will need to be addressed before committing to technology decisions for the dashboard and machine learning models.

- Size of dataset
- Cost
- Performance
- Time
