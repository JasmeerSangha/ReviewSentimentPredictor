# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
The following will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analsis.

- PySpark
- Pandas
- Google Colab


## Database Storage
Postgres/PgAdmin is the database we intend to use to store our data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. We will run our initial model using Naive Bayesian. To demonstrate which model best fits this project, we will run a few other models to display their comparisons.

## Dashboard
We will use HTML and CSS to create the front-end of our dashboard. We will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on GitHub Pages.
